# bota

A simplified Dota 2 in Rust for AI bots and humans. Architecture — `DESIGN.md`.

## Code conventions

### Documentation

A docstring answers "what is this", "what does it mean" and "when is it used". It never
answers "why was it decided this way".

- Rationale, alternatives, comparisons with rejected options and decision history live
  in `DESIGN.md`. Not in the code.
- One line is enough for a field. State units, range, invariants and what a zero or
  absent value means.
- Never write `deliberately`, `because`, "unlike option X", "this used to be".
- Do not record assumptions about how the other side works. If a fact has not been
  verified — it does not exist.
- A docstring that has grown large is almost always a sign that rationale ended up in
  the wrong place.
- English, ASCII only, rustdoc markup.

### lib.rs and mod.rs

`lib.rs` and `mod.rs` may contain **only** `mod` and `use`. No type definitions,
functions, constants, traits or `impl` — all of that lives in submodules.

Re-exports are predominantly wildcard:

```rust
// lib.rs
mod codec;
mod ids;
mod math;

pub use codec::*;
pub use ids::*;
pub use math::*;
```

The consequence to keep in mind: names must be unique across the crate, otherwise the
glob re-exports conflict. The conflict surfaces not at the declaration site but at the
use site, so type names are not picked carelessly.

### Tests

Tests are wired in only by declaring the module in `lib.rs` or `mod.rs`:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests;
```

Careful: `test`, not `tests`. `#[cfg(tests)]` is a condition on a feature that does not
exist — the module never gets compiled, the tests silently vanish, and `cargo test`
reports "0 passed" without a single error.

- Few tests — a `tests.rs` file next to the module.
- Many — a `tests/` directory with a `mod.rs` and groups split by file. That `mod.rs`
  falls under the general rule: only `mod` and `use`.
- No integration-test directory at the crate root.

Fixtures build structs by listing **all** fields, without `..Default::default()`.
This is the guard on type composition: a new field in `UnitView` breaks test
compilation and demands a conscious decision about what to put in it.

### Crate boundaries

Four crates: `bota-proto` (shared vocabulary + codec), `bota-server` (simulation +
networking), `bota-client`, `bota-bot`. All depend only on `proto`.

The membership criterion for `bota-proto` is the single rule deciding where code lives:

> If it does not cross the wire and is not needed to read the wire — it is not in `proto`.

That is why `World`, `MatchRng`, `Chance`, the balance constants and the ability
implementations live in `bota-server/src/sim/` and are unreachable from the client in
principle.

### bota-proto and bota-server

- No `f32`/`f64`: `#![deny(clippy::float_arithmetic)]`. Reason: `sin/cos/sqrt` from
  libm differ across platforms and break determinism. Float is allowed in `bota-client`
  (rendering) and in `bota-bot` (what gets recorded are the bot's orders, not its
  reasoning).
- No `HashMap`/`HashSet` in the simulation: iteration order is not guaranteed.
- No `std::time` in `sim/`: time exists only as ticks.
- `sim/` knows nothing about sockets or `PlayerId` — only `SlotId`.

### Dependencies

New external dependencies only after discussion. Allowed:

| Crate | Where | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `serde` (derive) | `bota-proto` | message serialization |
| `postcard` 1.1 | `bota-proto` | compact binary format |
| `macroquad` | `bota-client` | rendering |
| `rand_chacha` 0.10 | `bota-server` | PRNG |
| `clap` | `bota-server` | command line arguments |

The requirement for any primitive that affects the simulation: **value-stability**,
i.e. a guarantee of identical values across versions and platforms. Hence
`rand_chacha::ChaCha8Rng` rather than `rand::StdRng` (the latter is allowed to change
its algorithm in a minor release). For the same reason
`std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher` is not fit for `world.hash()` — that is
ten lines of FNV-1a.

### Versioning

Until the first release there is no versioning and no compatibility. The wire carries
no version field and no ruleset fingerprint; no protocol, replay or hash compatibility
is promised between pre-release commits. Mismatched builds are not detected — they are
simply not run against each other.

## Pre-commit checks

```
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --all
cargo test --all --release
```

Release is run separately not for speed: `debug_assert!` is off there, and overflow
behavior switches from panicking to saturating. A test that covers only one half fails
in the other mode — and it fails exactly where we would notice it last.
