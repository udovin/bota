# bota — design

A simplified Dota 2 in Rust for AI bots and humans. Fully deterministic simulation,
server authority, minimal dependencies.

Code conventions — `CLAUDE.md`.

## Key decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Client rendering | macroquad | one direct dependency, 2D + text out of the box, Linux/Win/macOS/WASM |
| Tick mode | Realtime **and** Lockstep | humans play in realtime, bots are debugged/trained in reproducible lockstep |
| v0.1 scope | 1v1, three lanes, 1 hero | a vertical slice of the whole stack on minimal content |
| Transport | TCP + length-prefixed frames | no tokio: a thread per client + a simulation thread + mpsc |
| Serialization | `serde` + `postcard` | derive removes ~250 lines of manual put/get; the format is compact (varint) and stable within 1.x |
| Player networking | full snapshots with fog | measured: 1425 bytes per snapshot in 1v1, 41 KB/s at 30 Hz. Deltas will be needed by 5v5, not earlier |
| Live spectating | the same snapshots, without fog | client-side simulation is impossible, and that is intentional |
| Replay | fogless `ServerMsg` stream + all orders | plays back without a server: the client reads frames from a file instead of a socket; coupled to the wire format only, so it survives balance changes; the client still cannot simulate |
| PRNG | `rand_chacha::ChaCha8Rng` in `bota-server` | value-stable by the crate's contract; `rand::StdRng` is **forbidden** — it is allowed to change its algorithm in a minor release |

## Structure

        ↑    ↑    ↑
   server  client  bot
```

The workspace contains all four.

The bot and the client are symmetric consumers of `proto`: a human and a bot see
literally the same `WorldView` type. No asymmetry that could be exploited.

### Membership criterion for bota-proto

The single rule deciding where code lives:

> If it does not cross the wire and is not needed to read the wire — it is not in `proto`.

| In `bota-proto` | In `bota-server` |
|---|---|
| `Fixed`, `Angle`, `Vec2`, `EntityId`, `SlotId`, `PlayerId`, `Team`, `HeroId`, `AbilityId`, `ItemId`, `AbilitySlot`, `ItemSlot`, `MapId`, `UnitKind` | `World`, `step`, units, combat, movement, vision, economy |
| `Order`, `EventKind`, `WorldView`, codec and framing | `Command`, `Event.visible_to`, `MatchRng`, `Stream`, `Chance`, `Ratio` |
| `MatchInfo`, `ClientMsg`, `ServerMsg`, `ReplayRecord` | `MatchConfig`, balance constants, hero stats, ability implementations |

A previous version of the design had a `bota-core` crate holding the simulation. It was
dropped: "core" had no checkable membership criterion, and `seed`, `tick_rate` and
`PlayerId` steadily leaked into it — exactly what does not belong there. A side benefit
of moving the simulation into the server: the client is **structurally** incapable of
simulating, `World` lives in a crate it does not depend on.

No ECS: `World` is a set of `Arena<T>` stores — generational slot arenas iterated in
slot order. Removing an entity bumps the slot's generation, so a stale `EntityId` never
resolves to whoever took the slot over.

## Contracts

### Simulation (server/src/sim)

```rust
pub struct MatchConfig {
    pub match_id: u64, pub master_key: [u8; 32], pub picks: Vec<Pick>,
    pub map: MapId, pub tick_rate: u16, pub mode: TickMode, pub ack_timeout_ticks: u32,
}

impl MatchConfig {
    pub fn rng(&self) -> MatchRng;        // see below
    pub fn info(&self) -> MatchInfo;      // projection onto the wire, the type has no seed field
}
```

The match seed is derived with `rand_chacha` itself, no separate hash function needed:
`master_key` is a 32-byte seed, `match_id` is a stream number. A match is reproducible
from the pair `(master_key, match_id)`, which is convenient for debugging. Implemented
in `sim/rng.rs`:

```rust
// MatchRng::new(master_key, match_id)
let mut root = ChaCha8Rng::from_seed(*master_key);
root.set_stream(match_id);
let mut seed = [0u8; 32];
root.fill_bytes(&mut seed);

// one stream per purpose — crits, runes, spawn scatter
rng.global(Purpose::Rune)
rng.for_unit(Purpose::Crit, unit, source)
```

Streams are separated by purpose (`Purpose`: `Crit`, `Block`, `Evasion`, `Rune`,
`NeutralSpawn`) so that a new draw in one place does not shift generation anywhere
else. A per-unit stream is keyed by `(purpose, slot index, source)` packed into the
64-bit ChaCha8 stream id — purpose in the top bits, slot index in the middle, a source
byte to separate several sources of chance on the same unit (a crit passive and a
bash). The key uses the slot index rather than the full `EntityId`: the stream id
space stays bounded, and a unit reusing a freed slot continues that slot's hidden
sequence, which no observer can distinguish from a fresh one.

```rust
impl World {
    pub fn new(cfg: &MatchConfig, rng: MatchRng) -> World;  // rng is initial state, not config
    pub fn step(&mut self, cmds: &[Command]) -> Vec<Event>;
    pub fn view(&self, team: Team) -> WorldView;        // with fog
    pub fn view_full(&self) -> WorldView;               // spectator
    pub fn can_see(&self, team: Team, target: EntityId) -> bool;   // order validation
    pub fn winner(&self) -> Option<Team>;
    pub fn stats(&self) -> MatchStats;
    pub fn hash(&self) -> u64;                          // determinism check
}
```

`seed` is not configuration but initial hidden state, so it is passed as a separate
argument, already a constructed `MatchRng`; the policy of deriving it belongs entirely
to the server.

The simulation knows about `SlotId` but not `PlayerId`: network identity must not leak
into the rules of the game. The mapping table lives in `Roster` in the lobby.

`Event.visible_to` is computed by the simulation — who sees what is a gameplay
question. The network layer only routes; what goes on the wire is `EventKind` without
the mask.

### Exchange

```
server:  World --view(team)--> WorldView --encode_frame--> socket
client:  socket --FrameReader--> WorldView --> rendering
```

The client's `WorldView` is born from the wire, not from a constructor. The client has
no `World` and cannot have one, so there is no second `new` contract either. The
asymmetry of the sides is expressed by two types — `World` versus `WorldView` — not by
two implementations of one trait.

There is intentionally no trait over `World`: no polymorphic call sites exist, and
determinism demands exactly one implementation.

## Determinism rules

1. No `f32/f64` in `bota-proto` and `bota-server`: `#![deny(clippy::float_arithmetic)]`.
   Float operations themselves are deterministic per IEEE-754, but `sin/cos/sqrt` from
   libm are not — they differ across glibc / musl / macOS / wasm. The client renders in
   float freely. The bot is also free to think in float: what gets recorded are its
   orders, not its reasoning.
2. Scalars are `Fixed` = Q16.16 in `i32`, multiplication through an intermediate `i64`.
   Range ±32768 units, precision 1/65536. The 16384-unit map keeps squared distances
   inside an `i64`; segment projections that would square a dot product go through
   `i128`.
3. Angles are "brads": `u16`, 65536 = a full turn. sin/cos from a hardcoded table of
   1024 entries.
4. Distances are compared as squares, no sqrt.
5. Entity iteration is always by ascending `EntityId.idx`. `HashMap` is forbidden in
   the simulation.
6. Commands are sorted by `(tick, slot, seq)` before applying.
7. Time exists only as ticks (`u32`), 30 ticks/sec. No `std::time` in `sim`.
8. Damage, gold, experience are integers.
9. External primitives are taken only if value-stable. `rand::StdRng` and
   `std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher` explicitly give no such guarantee
   between releases: the former is replaced by `rand_chacha::ChaCha8Rng`, and for
   `world.hash()` we write FNV-1a (ten lines, xor and multiply in a loop).
10. `world.hash()` covers the whole state, hidden included: entity arenas, stream
    positions, every `Chance` mask. A divergence in randomness consumption must move
    the hash on the tick it happens, not when its first visible outcome differs.

### Chances (crits, block, evasion)

The requirements conflict: an exact 30% rate **and** no way to predict the next crit.
A simple accumulator (`acc += 0.30`, firing at `acc >= 1`) gives the first but not the
second: it is periodic, an observer sees crits in damage events and reconstructs the
whole phase after one or two observations.

The solution is exact counting per block with a hidden order inside the block. A chance
is declared as a fraction:

```rust
pub struct Ratio { num: u8, den: u8 }     // rules.rs: CRIT_CHANCE = Ratio::new(3, 10)

pub struct Chance {
    stream: Stream,   // this source's own hidden ChaCha8 stream
    mask: u64,        // which attempts of the current block hit
    idx: u8,          // position within the block
    current: Ratio,   // the ratio the current block was built with
}

impl Chance {
    pub fn roll(&mut self, ratio: Ratio) -> bool {
        if self.idx >= self.current.den() {
            self.current = ratio;                     // new ratio takes effect here
            self.reshuffle();                         // partial Fisher-Yates off the stream
        }
        let hit = self.mask & (1 << self.idx) != 0;
        self.idx += 1;
        hit
    }
}
```

- The rate is exactly `num/den` per block. Balance constants are declared as fractions,
  `den <= 64` (the width of the mask).
- The order comes from a ChaCha8 stream: observing past crits says nothing about the
  next block. A replay reproduces bit-for-bit — the stream is deterministic, just
  unreachable from outside.
- The initial block offset of every source is drawn from the same stream, so block
  boundaries are not known to an observer.

Residual leak: within a block the opponent can count (saw 3 crits in 6 hits — knows the
next 4 are clean). Unavoidable for any scheme with an exact rate. The alternative is
giving up the exact rate for a plain hidden PRNG, which contradicts the determinism
requirement.

When the chance changes (a crit buff), the current block finishes under the old
fraction; the new one takes effect from the next block.

The PRNG is also used where an exact rate is meaningless (rune drop, spawn scatter).
Streams are separated by purpose via `ChaCha8Rng::set_stream`, so that a new call in
one place does not shift the rest of the generation.

### Hidden state

The hard rule: the client receives nothing from which a future outcome can be derived.
Players send intents, the server alone computes, and every tick it broadcasts the
outcome.

Secrecy is a property of the channel, not of the data, so the simulation does not think
about it. The protection is structural: the types of `bota-proto` are incapable of
expressing hidden state. `MatchInfo` versus `MatchConfig`, `WorldView` versus `World`.
A leak becomes a compile error, not a review oversight.

The seed is **never** published — not even in replays: a replay is a recorded stream
plus the orders, nothing in it is re-simulated, so nothing in it needs the seed.

Server-only, never reaches `WorldView`:

- `MatchRng` and the positions of all streams;
- each unit's `Chance { mask, idx }`;
- outcomes of scheduled events that have not happened yet (which rune will spawn).

Checked by a test: `view_full()` is run through serialization and compared against a
whitelist of fields, so a new field in `Unit` cannot leak silently.

It also follows that client-side prediction covers only movement and animation. Damage
numbers and the fact of a crit arrive as events from the server.

Two further channels are closed by rule, because a reward-driven bot will find and
exploit any leak a human reviewer shrugs off:

- A reject reason does not depend on hidden state. A dead target and a fogged one get
  the same `UnknownTarget`, so probing the fog with stale handles reveals nothing.
- A unit never acts on what its team cannot see. A standing `AttackUnit` order whose
  target left the team's vision degrades to attack-moving toward the last seen
  position; the unit does not track the hidden target, so its own path reveals
  nothing either.

## Game model v0.1

- Map 18432×18432 — Dota's scale, so speeds, ranges and vision keep their Dota
  absolute values. Symmetric along the diagonal. Three lanes: mid along the diagonal,
  top up the west edge and along the north edge, bottom its mirror; the diagonal
  mirror that swaps the sides also swaps top and bottom. Terrain is a 288×288 bit
  grid of 64-unit cells; walking is planned on a 576×576 lattice of 32-unit nodes
  laid over it.
- A second map, `MapId(1)`, is the game's own hero demo map (`hero_demo_main`),
  imported the same way: one short lane bending through its real path corners,
  a single tier-one tower a side, two fountains, its own 187 trees, its own
  ground — and no Ancients at all, so nothing ends a match there but the
  clock. The slot used to hold an invented three-tower training lane; the real
  demo map costs the same tables and is ground the bots' habits can carry to
  the big map. Its terrain is baked exactly like the big map's: walkability
  from the map's own gridnav, elevation tiers rasterised off its physics mesh
  in 128-unit steps — river bed 0, ground 1, the high spots 2, the cliffs
  above — the river as the water mask, and its one fog blocker wall sealing
  the river pit. It keeps two invented pullable camps in the wooded pockets
  either side of the lane, because the jungle's behaviours are tested against
  this map and the real one runs no jungle. Anything a map may lack is data
  now: `ancients` are per-side options, a side with none anchoring its lane
  at its wave spawner; the forest, the fog walls, the lane tree-clearing band
  and the baked ground are per-map tables. Whether the lane centerline is
  drawn through the towers is a map switch too: the big map's straightened
  lanes are defined by their towers, while the demo map's corners trace the
  real road and its towers stand beside it — drawn through them, every wave
  hooked around its own tower on the way out.
- A third, `MapId(2)`, is the Dota map to a short finish: the first side to lose
  a tower or to lose `SKIRMISH_DEATH_LIMIT` heroes loses; opposing losses in one
  tick draw. It spawns only mid waves and draws after fifteen gameplay minutes.
  The same ground, buildings and routes come from `SKIRMISH` using `..DOTA`,
  overriding only its id, wave selection and completion fields. What ends a
  match is map data now (`death_limit` and `tower_ends_it`) rather than a
  `map.id == MapId(1)` written into `fight.rs` twice: a rule keyed on which map
  it is cannot be given to a second map without being written a third time. The
  demo map used to carry both endings and now carries neither, which leaves it
  what its name says — a lane to try things in, ending the way the big map does.
- The per-map route cache is indexed by `MapId`, not by the position in `MAPS`,
  so the two have to agree; a test says so, since nothing else would notice a map
  added out of order.
- Teams Radiant / Dire, 1v1 (the architecture is sized for 5v5).
- Buildings: three towers per lane per side — tier one by the river, tier three by
  the base — plus a pair of tier fours by each Ancient, two barracks per lane
  behind its tier three (all at their real map positions), and a fountain that
  heals and burns. What may be struck when is map data: `MapDef.protection` is a
  list of rules, each guarding a structure with an and/or condition over the same
  side's already-fallen structures, and the guard is worn as invulnerability,
  recomputed after stats each tick. The Dota table opens each lane tower by tower
  into its barracks, opens the tier fours on any fallen tier three, and opens the
  Ancient only once both tier fours are down. A condition tree rather than a flat
  prerequisite list because "any tier three" and "both tier fours" are one Or and
  one all-matching name away from each other, and a flat list can say only one of
  them. A structure no rule names is open from the horn.
- A lane's centerline runs through every tower of the lane, so a wave marches from
  tower to tower and can never wander past one outside its own acquisition range.
- The match opens with a 30 s pregame: the game clock counts up from -0:30 and the
  first wave walks out at 0:00, when passive gold starts. `MatchInfo` carries the
  pregame length so the clock renders without knowing the ruleset.
- The landmarks are the current Dota 2 map, extracted from the installed game's
  `dota.vpk` with ValveResourceFormat and shifted by half the map so Dota's
  origin sits at the center: `MAP_SIZE` 18432, both fountains, both Ancients,
  all 22 towers, all 6 lane spawners and all 28 neutral camps at their real
  positions. The two sides are not mirrors; each carries its own table, and
  `mirror()` survives only as a utility.
- The terrain is the same map's own ground, baked in `sim/terrain.rs`: the
  gridnav's static walkability (cliffs, pits, the map edge close their cells
  before trees and buildings do) and, from the physics mesh, an elevation tier
  per cell in 128-unit steps — river bed 0, lane ground 1, highground 2, bases
  3 — plus the water mask of the river and pools. A ranged attack landing on
  ground higher than its attacker at impact uses Dota's 25% pseudo-random
  miss distribution for that attacker; buildings, flying attacks and
  abilities never miss this way. The terrain
  rides in `MatchStart` run-length encoded, and the client bakes it into the
  ground texture for the world and the minimap.
- Vision is a radius with sight lines walked over the terrain cells. A cell is
  opaque to a viewer when its ground is higher than the viewer's, when a tree
  stands on it, or when one of the map's own fog blocker walls crosses it —
  eleven named walls of `ent_fow_blocker_node` points, imported like
  everything else, which is what seals the river pit even through its
  entrance. A named group holds several separate walls: only nodes within
  the blocker span of each other bridge a segment, so the far-apart jumps
  inside a group — the two pits share one name — are breaks, not walls. Buildings, water and units block nothing. The viewer's own cell
  and the target's cell never block, so standing beside a tree does not blind
  and a treeline's edge stays visible; a target on ground above the viewer is
  always dark. The opaque cells ride in `MatchStart`, and the client walks
  the same sight lines from its own units to shade unseen ground in the world
  view and on the minimap; spectators see everything. The map's
  `ent_fow_revealer` points wait for outposts.
- Trees are static blockers imported one for one from the same map: all 2475
  positions — the main entity lump plus the base layers of both sides — live as
  a table in `sim/trees.rs`. Two carves adapt them to this map: trees within
  the lane-clear band of a straightened lane centerline are dropped — the real
  forest follows the real curved roads, and these lanes walk tower-to-tower
  chords — and a small pad around each fountain stays clear. The
  full tree list rides in `MatchStart`, so the client draws without knowing the
  layout rules. Trees are closed into the passability grid at world build; they
  do not block vision yet and are indestructible until an axe exists.
- The jungle belongs to `Team::Neutral`, hostile to both sides; seats never sit
  there. The twenty-eight camps stand where Dota's own neutral spawners stand. They
  fill with neutral creeps one minute past the horn and every minute after, but only while the camp box is empty — any body inside
  blocks the spawn, which is camp blocking. A neutral answers whoever comes into
  its aggro range or hits it, and dragged beyond its leash it goes home deaf and
  arrives at full health. Its bounty goes to the killer, its experience to the
  killer's team nearby.
- Creeps: 3 melee + 1 ranged every 900 ticks (30 s) on every lane, a siege creep
  every 5th wave. A wave marches its own lane's waypoints and is leashed to its own
  lane. A lane whose enemy melee or ranged barracks has fallen spawns that kind
  super, its siege once both are down, and every enemy barracks fallen makes the
  whole side's waves mega, at the game's own numbers; the flagbearer stays plain.
  A waypoint counts as reached from anywhere inside its radius, but only while
  the grid line to the waypoint after it is clear: the radius spans a tower, and
  clearing a corner waypoint through the tower it was routing around left one
  Radiant mid creep of every wave wrestling its own tier three.
  A tower landmark becomes a stop beside the tower, on its lane side away from
  the base it guards. With the game's own 144-unit tower hulls the centre is
  out of reach and the grid line past it never clears, so every wave stood
  wrestling its tier three; the nearest open cell picks a grid-arbitrary side
  and sent waves round the back of towers; and a stop facing the base lands in
  the pocket between a tier three and its barracks, walking the wave in and
  back out. The lane side is open on every tower of both maps.
  The routes are laid per world on the ground as it stands and laid again the
  next time a wave asks after the ground changes, with every marcher put at
  the waypoint of its new route nearest to it. Laid once per map, they kept
  every footprint for ever and a wave walked round the empty ground a fallen
  tower had stood on. A found path keeps only the corners the grid line
  cannot skip: cell by cell it rounded a footprint in right angles.
- Hero: Sylla (ranged carry). 3 abilities + an ultimate, levels 1–30 on the
  game's own experience table and respawn times, taken from the wiki in
  September 2026.
- Economy: passive gold 1/sec, last hits, a hero kill bounty priced by the
  victim's streak, a hero's head worth in experience a base, thirteen percent
  of what the fallen had earned and the game's own bonus for the streak it
  ends, and a death that costs the fallen a fortieth of its net worth, capped
  by the purse. The `Died` event carries the gold the killing side was
  paid, so a seat reads off the wire what a fight moved. The kill constants
  sat in `rules.rs` unwired for a while — heroes spawned with no bounty
  component, so bringing one down paid nothing and dying cost nothing but the
  respawn wait, which a breeding search reads as a licence to feed. The dying
  hero's gold is not handed to the killer but vanishes, as in Dota: the
  penalty prices the death, the bounty prices the kill, and a broke victim
  still pays its killer in full.
- Attributes are Dota's three: strength buys health and health regeneration,
  agility buys armor and attack speed, intelligence buys mana and mana
  regeneration, and whichever one a hero is primary in buys its attack damage.
  They are held in fixed point rather than whole points, because Dota's growth
  per level is fractional and rounding it to whole numbers would put the same
  hero on two different curves depending on where the rounding fell. They sit
  on `UnitDef` and in `Stats`, so a creep simply has none of them and pays for
  nothing; the derivation runs once, after items have been added and before
  anything reads what attributes pay for. The base numbers of both heroes were
  cut by exactly what their attributes now hand back, so level one is the body
  it always was.
  The alternative — leaving attributes out and giving every item flat health,
  mana and damage — was rejected because it throws away the whole cheap end of
  the Dota shop: Circlet, the three 140-gold attribute items, Bracer and its
  two siblings all exist to be bought as attributes, and inventing replacements
  for them is work with nothing behind it.
- Attack speed is a number on the Dota scale, where 100 is a unit's own pace,
  and the interval between two attacks is the kind's own interval scaled by it.
  It replaces the earlier haste effect, which took a percentage off the
  interval directly: percentages off an interval do not add up — two sources of
  twenty percent are not forty — so item bonuses and Frenzy could not have been
  put on the same footing. The bounds are Dota's, 20 to 700.
- Items are built from components. Every built item's price is exactly the sum
  of its parts, with the difference carried by an ordinary catalog entry — a
  recipe — rather than by a number on the item, so there is one rule for what a
  build costs and no second place to keep it. Buying a built item buys only the
  parts the seat does not already hold, asking the same question of a part that
  is itself built, which is what makes buying a component now and the whole
  later worth anything. The build itself runs once a tick over every hero's
  bag rather than at each place an item can arrive: a purchase, a slot moved
  and a courier setting one down would otherwise each need their own hook, and
  a missed one would leave parts sitting side by side. Only what a hero
  carries builds; the stash does not, since it is a shelf at the shop and not a
  pair of hands.
- Items follow the Dota slot topology, engine in `game/systems/gear.rs`. A seat owns
  fifteen slots: six inventory, where items work; three backpack, where they ride
  inert — and a stack leaving the backpack for the inventory is muted for six
  seconds before it works again; six stash. A purchase spends gold anywhere, but lands in the
  inventory only inside the home shop area (the fountain circle) — bought
  remotely it waits in the stash, and the stash itself opens only at that shop.
  Selling also happens at the shop: half price back, the full price for an
  untouched item within ten seconds of purchase. `MoveItem` swaps any two slots.
  Carried bonuses are flat and apply only from unmuted inventory slots; a pool
  keeps its filled fraction whichever way its maximum moves. The earlier rule —
  grow by the whole delta, shrink by clamping alone — was a mint: a Power
  Treads wheel (strength → agility → intelligence → strength) re-gained on
  every switch back what the switch away never took, and a few dozen switches
  refilled both pools from next to nothing. The scaling floors, so a full
  wheel can only lose a sliver, never gain one; and a pool that held anything
  is kept off zero, so the wheel cannot kill its owner either. Consumables
  (Healing Salve, Clarity) drip over
  thirty seconds and spill on any hit from a hero. Items survive the hero's
  death on the seat.
- An item set to an attribute — Power Treads — keeps which one on the stack
  rather than in the catalog, and the wire carries it in `ItemView`, since two
  players holding the same item may have it on different attributes and the
  client has to draw which. Switching is an ordinary `UseItem` with no target:
  a second order kind for one item would be a wire change bought for nothing.
- Blink is a point-targeted use like any other. Aimed further off than it
  carries it carries as far as it does along the same line rather than
  refusing, which is how Dota reads a click past the edge of the range. A
  landing spot on closed ground steps back along that line a grid cell at a
  time until it finds open ground: refusing outright would have been simpler,
  but it makes the item unusable at exactly the cliffs it exists to cross.
  A blow from a hero or a tower sets it back, and that lives in the
  same place a blow already puts a Salve out, so there is one pass over what a
  blow breaks rather than two.
- Charges gained from enemy casts — Magic Stick and Wand — are counted where
  the cast succeeds, not from the event stream: the events a side is told of
  are already filtered by what it may see, and charges do not answer to
  vision. A stack that may gain charges is kept when its last one is spent;
  every other stack is gone with it.
- An item on the ground is an entity: a transform and the whole stack, charges,
  attribute mode and the rest riding along untouched. An entity rather than a
  world-level list because everything wanted comes with it — a stable
  `EntityId` for an order to name, and the same visibility rows units use, so
  the fog covers ground items without a line of new code. It has no team, no
  health and no hull: it is walked through, cannot be struck, and lies there
  until somebody takes it. Anybody with a bag may — enemies included, which is
  the whole drama of a courier shot down over the river or a Gem dropped in
  Dota. What keeps theft from being a bank raid is ownership, below.
- Two orders cover the ground: `PutItem` lays what sits in a bag slot out —
  at a point, underfoot when aimed at nothing, or into the first free slot of
  an allied bag when aimed at a unit — and `TakeItem` picks a ground item up.
  Dropping and handing over are one order, not two, because they are one
  motion — out of the bag, differing only in where it lands — and
  `OrderTarget` already spells the difference. Both orders walk their unit
  into reach first, the way Dota reads a drop aimed across the map; an aimed
  unit may be moving, so following is needed anyway, and one walk serves both.
  The walking lives in one `Handling` component and one tick pass shaped like
  the courier's errands, cancelled where an errand is: any later order calls
  it off. Item actives refuse beyond their reach instead of walking, and stay
  that way: a use is aimed where the fight is, a put is aimed where the feet
  will be.
- The stash does not `PutItem`: it is a shelf at the shop, not a pair of
  hands. Move the item into the bag first.
- Selling away from the shop marks the stack for sale instead of refusing; a
  second sell order on the slot unmarks it, so no new order kind is spent on
  cancelling. A marked stack still carries its bonuses — it is owned until it
  is sold — but takes no part in builds, or the boots marked for sale would
  vanish into Power Treads mid-flight. The sale itself is a per-tick pass over
  what stands at the shop, the same shape and the same argument as builds:
  the marked stack may arrive by courier, in its owner's bag, or already sit
  in the stash, and a pass owns all three where hooks would multiply. The
  courier folds in with one change: delivery hands over its load, then takes
  every marked stack from the owner's bag, and the existing put-back leg
  carries them to the stash where the pass sells them. A courier called with
  an empty bag still flies out when something is marked: the call is the ask.
- Every stack knows the seat that bought it, and only that seat may sell or
  mark it. Without this, sell-by-ally is a wire for pumping gold between
  seats, and an enemy who picks a dropped item up cashes it at the shop.
  Wearing, using and handing back are all allowed on anybody's stack — the
  rule guards the till, not the hands. Ownership stays server-side; the wire
  does not carry it.
- Fog of war is mandatory: without it a bot learns to play with full information.
- Victory: the Ancient falls.

Aggro replicates Dota. Nobody ranks targets by kind: creeps and towers take the
closest enemy in reach — creeps fighting creeps and towers shooting creeps are
emergent, because creeps arrive first. On top of that sit the aggro calls:

- An attack order against an enemy hero, and every attack swing at one, calls the
  victim's creeps within a radius of the attacker — and the victim's towers the
  attacker stands in reach of — onto the attacker. Creeps hold the grudge for a
  couple of seconds; a tower holds its target for as long as it stays in reach.
- An order aimed at any ally calls enemy creeps and towers off the orderer: the
  classic last-hit-under-pressure trick. Against a healthy ally the order itself is a
  follow, turning into a deny once the ally is low enough.
- Each creep and tower can be called onto a target at most once per call cooldown. A
  call-off works at any time, and until that cooldown expires the called-off unit
  prefers any other target over the orderer, coming back only when nobody else is in
  reach: the trick redirects, it does not blind.
- A creep holds a non-hero target until it dies or the chase breaks: standing closer
  steals no attention, so last-hitting next to a busy wave is safe. A target inside
  the creep's own attack range is held no matter what it is — a ranged creep keeps
  firing at a hero who stays in its range. What the aggro window limits is chasing a
  hero beyond that range: when it closes, the creep re-assesses from the closest
  again, and a kited chase loses to whatever got closer on the way, a tower included.
  Last-hitting creeps calls nobody.
- A hero fights only when told to, but a fight it was told to have carries itself:
  when an attack order's target dies, the order degrades to an attack-move at the
  spot it fell, and the fight carries on with whatever acquisition finds there.
  An aimed cast takes the body over: the order it was given over is not returned
  to, the body swings at nothing while the cast waits, and once the cast has
  gone off the hero takes on whatever acquisition finds. A cast at oneself asks
  nothing of the body and leaves its order be. Arriving off a move
  order or stopping leaves the wave alone. A move order ignores enemies for its
  whole length, Hold attacks whatever is in range without moving, attack-move
  acquires along the way.
- A body has two radii, as in Dota: the collision size nothing walks into, and
  the smaller bound radius that attack range, cast range and areas are measured
  to. One radius served both until the hulls were brought to Dota's numbers: the
  bound radius as a hull packed waves tighter than Dota's and let creeps stand
  where Dota's could not, while the collision size as a reach would have
  lengthened every attack and cast by the difference. All contact is solid: the
  distance between two units never drops below the sum of their collision sizes,
  and a step deeper into anybody's circle is refused. Easing apart is a safety
  net for spawns and shoves, four units a tick; nothing else moves a body but its
  own step.
- Walking is planned in three layers, one over the other, all in integers.
  The static layer is the ground as a body meets it. Terrain closes 64-unit
  cells, met as squares; a tree is the circle of its trunk; a structure the
  circle of its collision size. Over them a lattice of 32-unit nodes keeps at
  every node the room a body has there: the distance from the node's centre to
  the nearest obstacle, capped at 96 units. The terrain's part of the field is
  baked once per map in two one-dimensional passes and cached for the process;
  buildings and trees are laid into it as circles and taken out again by redoing
  the window about them, so a tree felled costs a window, not the map. An exact
  test says whether a body of a radius can walk a segment: the circles come from
  a bucket index, the closed cells are met about every node the segment crosses,
  and a node whose room exceeds the radius and half its own diagonal is passed
  without looking. A body already inside an obstacle is let out: an obstacle it
  overlaps stops only a step that comes nearer it somewhere along the way than
  where the body stands; a step that merely ended further off was let through
  the middle of a wall of bodies. The old 64-cell grid tested
  only the walker's centre against trees and terrain and kept room about
  structures alone: a hero walked with its body inside a tree, and a corridor two
  cells wide was open or shut by the luck of where its centres fell. Read at 32
  the corridor is right for every body up to the siege creep's, and the exact
  test is what makes a plan honest: nothing a route asks is refused by the ground
  it was planned on. Closed terrain stands as solid squares for the body, which
  shuts a two-cell corridor to bodies wider than 32 units, the melee and siege
  creeps; Dota reads terrain against the centre alone. One field and one rule
  were taken over two fields: the wide bodies plan round such corridors and
  heroes pass them.
  The route is A* over the lattice, eight-connected, never cutting a blocked
  corner, a node open when its room covers the body's collision size and an
  8-unit margin, in scratch kept between searches under an epoch stamp, with a
  budget of expansions past which the walk goes to the nearest node reached. The
  corners found are pulled straight against the exact test, then each drawn in
  along the bisector of its legs by binary search as far as both legs stay clear,
  then pulled again, so they land on the tangents of what they round to within a
  unit. A goal that cannot be stood on ends the route at the first node with room
  on the walker's own side of it, or at the goal itself when that lies in a
  straight line from the node. A route is kept while its goal drifts under 128
  units, its last leg swung onto a goal that moved a little, its corners dropped
  as they are passed, beside one or beyond it along the next leg with that leg
  clear, and laid again from where the walker stands when the way to its next
  corner is shut. Lane routes are laid for the widest marcher, as before.
  The plan is the next stretch of the walk, tick by tick, laid by A* over states
  of spot, facing and tick, at most 40 ticks ahead. A step of the search is a
  stretch of four ticks along one of sixteen headings or straight at the aim,
  the turn onto it paid first in ticks stood still exactly as the walk would
  stand them, or four ticks stood waiting for a body to pass, or the last few
  ticks straight at the aim. The cost is time; a tie falls to the state nearer
  the aim, then to fewer turns. Headings more than five of the sixteen off the
  way to the aim are not tried: a way back is the route's to find. Bodies within
  the walker's reach over the horizon and their own are foreseen: by their own
  plans where a body planned earlier in the tick, else by their last step carried
  forward twelve ticks and held; a stretch that would bring the body within the
  two collision sizes of a foreseen body at any tick is not taken. The search
  expands at most 80 states and settles for the state nearest the aim, and
  answers nothing when that is under two steps nearer. The aim is a spot up to
  440 units along the route, as far as a straight line from the walker stays
  clear; on the last stretch the route's end, with the order's own arrival: an
  attack's reach, the touching distance of a follow, nothing for a walk. A walk
  with a reach is judged against the destination itself rather than the spot
  the route ends on beside it: a tower's centre cannot be stood on, but its
  reach is measured from there, and a melee hero that judged its reach from the
  spot beside the tower stood short of it and never swung.
  Steering was tried first: three swings off the line, a side held until the way
  ahead cleared, slides along a graze. It pressed walkers into crowds, wiggled
  them at walls, and could not see a body coming. A search over time finds the
  way round a moving body before contact and the wait that lets it pass, and its
  cost is the walk's own turn rule, so what it plans is what happens.
  A hero is foreseen only where it stands, and only once it has stood there
  eight ticks or has been run into six times in three seconds: it goes where a
  player sends it next, which nothing here knows, and a creep that read its
  plan walked round it before it got there. A hero on the move is met when it
  is met.
  A plan is walked a step a tick. Each step is checked against the bodies as
  they now stand: one that has come to stand in the step refuses it, and one
  that was itself moving costs a block wait of eight ticks stood still, after
  which the way straight on is tried again. That is what keeps creep blocking:
  a creep a hero keeps stepping in front of runs into it, stands, tries again
  and is held to the hero's pace, while the creeps the hero does not cover pass
  by its sides, and a hero that stands still is flowed round. A creep run into
  a hero six times in three seconds plans round where the hero stands, so a
  hero merely walking up the lane ahead of its wave does not hold it for ever. A plan is laid again when its route goal has moved 64
  units, the body's speed changed, the body was put somewhere else, fewer than
  12 ticks of it are left short of the route's end, or a step was refused, and
  not oftener than every four ticks, or sixteen once the body has stood stalled
  a second. A body that stands this tick, held, swinging, in reach of what it
  fights or with nowhere to go, forgets its plan: creeps stood fighting once
  kept the plans they had marched by, a hero read them as about to walk off,
  planned straight through them, ran into them and stood the block wait, over
  and over. A plan that falls short of its aim with bodies about lays the route
  again at once round the bodies standing there as if they were structures,
  within a small budget and not oftener than every 48 ticks: a wall of them is
  too wide for the plan's own budget to find its way round, and waiting twelve
  stalled ticks for that was two seconds of dithering at every wave. What the
  body can walk is judged at its own size, not the route's margin: pressed
  against a tower, a body saw no corner along it at the margin and laid its
  route again every tick. A creep stalled thirty ticks walks into whatever
  stands in its way and is eased out after.
  Coming round costs whole ticks, so a turn a little short of the way is the
  faster start: a walk sent straight back sets off a heading short of the
  reverse and comes onto the way as it goes, a curve of a few tens of units,
  which the search finds on its own.
  In the thick of the demo map's wave fight, ten creeps cost about 50 to 70
  microseconds a tick in release and under 10 elsewhere; the steering they
  replace cost 5 to 10 throughout. A map's field is baked once per process in 15
  milliseconds, its lane routes in 3, a route across the map in half of one.
- A creep is on its lane route as on a rail: it aims at the next waypoint it has
  not passed, a waypoint passed once the creep stands within 250 units of it or
  beside or beyond it along the leg to the next with the leg clear, and it
  rejoins the rail there after a chase or a push, never at where it left. The
  anchor it used to walk back to walked waves backwards after every chase.
- A calm creep dragged off the lane beyond its leash gives up, goes deaf to targets
  and walks straight back to the nearest point of the lane; an open aggro window
  overrides the leash.
- Units turn at a finite rate and only walk or swing once they face their current
  path leg, so corners cost time. Buildings do not turn.

Every swing ends in a backswing the unit stands through, which is the
pause a creep makes over its kill before marching on. A hero's order cancels its
backswing.

Abilities run on a shared engine in `sim/abilities.rs`: a row of slots per hero —
four for most, six for Shadow Fiend, the row is per-hero data — each slot with a
level and a cooldown, held on the seat like items, so both survive the
hero's death — and cooldowns keep running while it is dead. A skill point arrives
with every hero level; basic ability level k needs hero level 2k-1, ultimate
levels open at 6, 12 and 18, as in the game. Slots may share a level: `learn_group` folds a family
of ids into one, a point into any of them levels the whole family, and the point
accounting counts the family once. The razes are the one family so far. A cast
order is validated (learned, off cooldown, mana, target kind, cast range) and
executes in the ability phase of the same tick, instantly — cast points and
channeling come later. Casts of the same tick run after cooldown ticking, so a
fresh cooldown surfaces at its full value. Sylla's kit: slot 0 a critical strike
passive fed by the hidden per-unit `Chance` stream (the stream is keyed by the
arena slot, so respawning continues the sequence); slot 1 an attack speed
self-buff for its duration; slot 2 a magical
projectile that bounces to the closest unhit enemy in range, never a structure;
slot 3 an ultimate volley launching an attack projectile at every enemy unit in
its radius. A crit rolls once at windup completion and rides the projectile,
reported only in the `Damaged` event.

Shadow Fiend carries Dota's six entries in six slots: three razes, Necromastery,
Presence of the Dark Lord and Requiem of Souls. An earlier cut squeezed him into four —
Necromastery as an innate `souls` flag on `HeroDef` with a cap that grew with the hero
level, Presence dropped outright — and was thrown away once the slot row became per-hero
data: the panel already draws six boxes for the courier, so the squeeze was buying
nothing. The three razes share one level, which is Dota's rule and what keeps the trio
from costing twelve points: a point into any of them levels all three, and the spent-point
sum counts the trio once. Necromastery is an ordinary leveled passive again — the soul
cap reads its level, and nothing is gathered while it is unlearned. Presence is a leveled
aura on the enemy: each tick it lays an armor-break status with a short linger on
everything hostile in reach, and the stats pass reads that status like any other. It does
not go through the `Auras` component, which is static body data handed out to its own
side; a presence is as strong as its learned level, which a `&'static [Aura]` cannot say.

### What a tower and a flagbearer hand out

Both are Dota's, and the numbers are the wiki's rather than anybody's memory. A tower's
**Tower Protection** reaches 900 and adds 3 armor and 1 health a second at tier one, 5
and 3 at every tier above it — so both figures are tables indexed by tier, not the flat
numbers a first reading of them gives. It reaches **allied heroes only**; Dota adds
creep-heroes and illusions, of which this game has neither. A **flagbearer**'s
inspiration reaches 700, mends 3 a second, and reaches **everyone of its own side**,
heroes counted in. Both linger half a second, which is what the `ticks` on an `Aura`
buys, and neither stacks, because `Statuses::put` keeps one status of a kind.

`Aura` grew a `Reach` for the tower: it used to hand out to the whole of its own side,
which the fountain and the flagbearer do and the tower does not. `Guarded` and `Inspired`
are separate kinds even though a body could carry both, because naming them apart is what
lets a client tell a tower's doing from a flagbearer's, and what keeps the bot from
reading either as the mending a salve puts on.

What a flagbearer's death pays the enemy heroes around it is **not** here. The wire's
`UnitKind::CreepFlagbearer` says it is, and nothing implements it: in Dota the bounty
reaches 1200 and pays every enemy hero in it once, on top of whatever the killer earns.
The doc is ahead of the code, which is the wrong way round.

Two more places fall short of the wiki, and neither is reachable on the maps as they
stand. Several auras are not meant to stack, and they do not — but which one holds is
whichever was handed out last rather than the strongest, since `Statuses::put` keeps one
status of a kind and the last writer wins. Two towers would have to stand within 1800 of
each other for it to show, and the nearest pair on the Dota map is 2239 apart. And a
tower's protection is meant to pass an invulnerable hero by only when it is *hidden*;
nothing here checks that, and no hero in the game can hide.

**An effect id is a wire vocabulary that lives in neither crate.** The server hands them
out in `project.rs` and the client reads them in `catalog.rs`, and nothing holds the two
lists together: adding the tower and flagbearer effects left the client drawing `?`
chips, and every test passed, because the client's tests only check that its own catalog
is indexed by its own ids. By the membership rule the ids cross the wire and are needed
to read it, so they belong in `bota-proto` — which is where the next one added should
put them.

A soul is taken only from what he brings down himself, which is the killer `bury`
already carries, and a hero is worth three where anything else is worth one. Souls
outlive his own death — they wait on the seat in `Kept` with the abilities and the
items — which Dota does not do. Dota's version spends the accumulation twice, once on
death and once on the requiem, and a hero whose only scaling is a resource that two
different events take away is a hero the bots learn to stop gathering with. The requiem
therefore reads the souls and keeps them; its cooldown is what limits it.

Souls are not a component of their own. Necromastery and Flesh Heap are the same shape -
a count that grows on a death, never runs out, and survives the body - so both are one
`Stacks` component keyed by `StackKind`, and a third of them costs a variant rather than
a table, a field in `StatsCx`, a line in the hash and a line in the projection. The wire
follows: an effect carries an `EffectAmount`, either `Ticks` for one that runs out or
`Stacks` for one that is counted, and a gathered count travels as an ordinary effect with
its own `EffectId`. A `souls: u32` on `UnitView` was written first and thrown away: it
puts one hero's vocabulary into the shared one, it says nothing about the flesh heap,
which has the same shape and was not on the wire at all, and every counter after it would
have to buy its own field. The two counts are separate optional fields rather than one
enum of `Ticks` or `Stacks`: an effect that stacks and also runs out is an ordinary thing
to want - Dota's Fury Swipes is one - and a sum type forecloses it in the shared
vocabulary, which is the expensive place to be wrong. The byte an effect pays for the
second `Option` buys that.

A raze takes no aim: it is fired along the caster's facing and lands at its own
distance, as in Dota. The first version aimed it at a point instead, because the engine
had no way back from an angle to a direction — `facing_towards` is a piecewise-linear
octant map — and the only exact line was caster-to-point. The way back turned out to be
ten lines of the same integer arithmetic: `heading_of` inverts the octant map exactly,
so a facing round-trips through it without drift, and the aim vocabulary for a raze
shrinks to `Own`. The consequences: the cast goes off on the tick it is asked for and
never walks the caster in, an order is not interrupted by it — he razes mid-walk and
mid-attack — and pointing it is done with the body, by turning. Facing was cosmetic
once; it has been load-bearing since attacks began waiting on it, and the razes now
lean on it too.

Hero roadmap (added as data + ability implementations; the engine does not change):

| Hero | Type | Abilities |
|---|---|---|
| Sylla | ranged carry | crit passive / attack speed buff / bouncing projectile / ult: multishot |
| Krag | melee tank | stun dash / cleave passive / armor aura / ult: shield + damage return |
| Vex | ranged nuker | nuke / slowing AoE / mana passive / ult: AoE burst |
| Grum | melee initiator | hook / DoT aura / slow / ult: AoE stun |
| Lira | support | heal / shield / wards / ult: team heal aura |

Built since: Pudge (hook / rot / flesh heap / ult: dismember) and Shadow Fiend
(three razes sharing a level / necromastery / presence / ult: requiem).

Flesh Heap is the 7.28 to 7.30 passive, from the wiki's changelog: 12/14/16/18%
magic resistance multiplied with the hero's own and 1.5/2/2.5/3 strength a stack
by level, a stack for every enemy hero dying within 450. Today's game splits it
into an innate strength heap and an active damage block, Meat Shield; a passive
whose levels changed nothing left three of four points dead, and an innate
without the active half is a slot with nothing in it.

## Protocol

Frame: `u32 len (LE) | postcard payload`. The message kind is the postcard enum tag
inside the payload. TCP, `TCP_NODELAY`.

Until the first release there is no versioning and no compatibility: the wire carries
no version field and no ruleset fingerprint, and nothing — protocol, replay files,
hash baselines — promises to survive across pre-release commits. Mismatched builds
are not detected; they are simply not run against each other. Version and fingerprint
fields appear with the first release, when there is something to be compatible with.

### Client → server

```rust
enum ClientMsg {
    Hello { role: Role, name: String },    // Role: Player|Bot|Spectator
    PickHero { hero: HeroId },
    SetReady(bool),
    Order { seq: u32, order: Order },
    Ack { tick: u32 },                     // lockstep: "I am ready for the tick"
}

enum Order {
    Move { target: Target }, Attack { target: Target },
    Cast { slot: AbilitySlot, target: Target },
    Use { slot: ItemSlot, target: Target },
    Learn { slot: AbilitySlot },
    Buy { item: ItemId }, Sell { slot: ItemSlot },
}

enum Target { None, Pos(Vec2), Unit(EntityId) }
```

Casting is one variant, `Cast`, with the target kind expressed by
`Target`; whether the variant fits the ability is validated by the server
(`RejectReason::WrongTargetKind`).

There is no chat in the protocol. The server exists for local bot testing; a message
type that plays no part in the match is not worth its slot in the wire format.

### Server → client

```rust
enum ServerMsg {
    Welcome { player_id: PlayerId, slot: Option<SlotId>, tick_rate: u16, mode: TickMode },
    LobbyState { slots: Vec<LobbySlot> },
    MatchStart { info: MatchInfo },        // the type has no seed field
    Snapshot { view: WorldView },          // whole; the tick is inside the view itself
    Events { tick: u32, events: Vec<EventKind> },
    OrderRejected { seq: u32, reason: RejectReason },
    MatchOver { winner: Team, stats: MatchStats },
    ParticipantLeft { player_id: PlayerId, slot: Option<SlotId> },
}
```

A Player/Bot receives a whole `WorldView` on every tick, filtered through its team's
fog. A live Spectator receives the same stream unfiltered. There are no deltas: a
client can start rendering from any snapshot, so joining mid-match requires nothing
special. Measured: 1425 bytes per snapshot in 1v1 (25 entities), 41 KB/s at 30 Hz.
`diff`/`apply` will arrive together with 5v5, where it would reach about 150 KB/s.

Within a tick the order on the wire is fixed: `Snapshot(t)`, then `Events(t)`. An
event may name an entity the snapshot no longer carries — it died on that very tick;
the previous snapshot is what to render such an event against.

A slow consumer cannot stall the simulation: the tick thread never blocks on a
socket. Snapshots are coalescible by construction — each one is whole, so a
connection that fell behind is sent only the latest. Events cannot be skipped, so a
connection whose event queue overflows is closed instead of buffered without bound.

The vision mask does **not** go over the wire. It is derived from the positions and
`vision_radius` of the units already present in the view: your own units are always
visible, so the computation needs nothing beyond what the client already received.
Saves two kilobytes per snapshot.

There is no shared implementation in `proto`, and that is not an omission. The sides
need different things: the server — an exact answer to "does this team see this
point", the client — a soft gradient for rendering with fade-out and a memory of the
explored, the bot often nothing at all. One shared function would either spoil the
picture or coarsen the filter.

The server-side representation of vision is intentionally not pinned down in the
design. A grid is not the only option and probably not the best one: as soon as trees
and vision cones appear, region geometry becomes both more precise and cheaper. This
is decided when `sim/vision.rs` is implemented. For the same reason each side keeps
its own mask type and grid constants — they do not cross the wire and are not needed
to read it.

This rests on two conditions, and breaking either puts the mask back on the wire:

1. Vision is a pure radius. As soon as terrain starts occluding it, the computation
   becomes a game rule, and rules do not belong in `proto`.
2. Every source of vision is represented by an entity in the view. Wards already
   satisfy this; an ability granting vision without a unit must be modeled as an
   invisible source entity.

Divergence of the computations is safe: the server alone decides which units enter the
view, so a bug in the client's mask paints the ground a wrong shade and reveals
nothing.

A replay is a self-contained recording that plays back without a server. A `.brp`
file is a sequence of length-prefixed frames, framed exactly like the socket, each
holding a `ReplayRecord`:

```rust
enum ReplayRecord {
    Msg(ServerMsg),                                       // the fogless spectator stream
    Orders { tick: u32, orders: Vec<(SlotId, Order)> },   // what every seat asked for
}
```

The server records `MatchStart`, then per tick the fogless `Snapshot`, the `Events`
and the orders it accepted. `ReplayRecord` lives in `bota-proto`: a replay file is a
wire, and the client must read it. Replay mode in the client is reading frames from
the file instead of the socket; the order records can be skipped, or rendered — which
is what makes a replay more useful than a live spectator seat when debugging a bot.
Nothing in the file is re-simulated: a replay is coupled to the wire format only,
survives balance changes, and grants the client nothing beyond what a live spectator
already gets. Snapshots are whole, so rendering can resume from any point of the
file. In 1v1 the stream runs at about 2.5 MB per minute; archiving is an external
compressor's job, not the protocol's.

### Bounded replay playback in the client

Opening a replay must not depend on its duration. The client previously read the
whole file, fed it to the socket `FrameReader`, and decoded every record before
the first render. Removing each decoded prefix from that reader moved the entire
remaining tail. A roughly 500 MB, 127,000-record replay therefore incurred
quadratic copying as well as retaining all decoded snapshots. A window already
created by macroquad stayed black during that work. Small counted-reader and
clock tests reproduced the failure without running the large files through the
old loader.

The replay player now opens the file without reading records. A client-local
`BufReader<Read>` reads the existing little-endian length prefix and calls the
existing `decode_payload` on one record at a time. The shared codec, replay
format, server and live networking are unchanged. A file-sized byte buffer, a
decoded frame queue, a background producer and a replay index are unnecessary
for forward playback; omitting them also removes producer backpressure and
thread shutdown protocols. One future record is retained as lookahead.

Each GUI-frame poll has three independent limits: 64 records inspected or
released, 256 KiB of framing/payload bytes consumed, and 128 reader calls,
including interruptions. Read-ahead is another 8 KiB at most. The existing
4 MiB payload limit is checked before allocation. A payload can span polls;
prefix and payload progress survive the yield, and the reusable byte buffer
never exceeds that payload limit. An already partly read or waiting record can
complete in a later batch, so a batch's decoded contents are bounded by one
maximum payload plus that poll's byte budget, not just by the byte budget.
Decoded Rust values can occupy more than their encoded bytes. Neither their
retention nor the parser's storage grows with replay length. These are work and
storage bounds, not a wall-clock timeout on a synchronous filesystem call or
a new validator of game data inside decodable records.

The first snapshot is a render boundary: startup stops there without decoding
the rest of the replay, and the clock anchors to that snapshot's tick. Loading
polls and the interval spent drawing the first snapshot do not advance playback.
Otherwise macroquad's previous frame time could count loading or first-use
rendering as game time and silently skip the start. Later elapsed time uses the
recorded tick rate and selected speed. Budget exhaustion leaves the target clock
fixed while subsequent frames finish the queued work, rather than accumulating
an ever-growing catch-up debt. Pause stops elapsed-time advancement; previously
queued work still completes. A step or forward jump only moves the target clock,
clamped to the largest wire tick, and performs no I/O; the next ordinary poll
does the work. There is no second decoding pass from input handling and no
backward seek or replay-sized index.

Records keep file order across all yields. `ReplayRecord::Orders` is converted
in place to the already supported `ServerMsg::Orders`, instead of waiting in an
independent order queue. This both bounds retention without a separate consumer
and makes step-delivered orders reach the overlay with their snapshots/events,
not on a later GUI frame. Snapshots and order records gate on their ticks;
intervening messages retain the recorded sequence, including the final events
and `MatchOver` before EOF.

Clean EOF is distinct from an empty recording, a partial prefix, a partial
payload, an invalid length, a decoding failure and a reader failure. A failure
keeps the record number and byte offset, stops further reads, and leaves already
decoded messages available for that frame. The client shows a loading screen
before opening and before the first snapshot, and a persistent error over the
last view on failure. EOF alone does not invent a match result.

Headless release tests use counted, fragmented and virtual gigabyte readers to
verify the limits without timing assertions or sleeps. The explicitly ignored
`both_real_replays_stream_correctly_with_bounded_prefix` test takes
`BOTA_REPLAY_NEURAL` and `BOTA_REPLAY_TEACHER` paths. It compares every streamed
message against an independent sequential record reader, checks complete EOF and
match results for both artifacts, and reports first-snapshot read counts and
full-scan measurements. GUI validation remains separate from that parser probe.

### What a slot is worth, and who works it out

Everything a slot of the panel shows about the thing in it rides in that unit's
own view, already worked out by the server: the range of the next cast, its
mana, whether a toggle is on, whether a skill point could go into it. None of
it is a number the client looks up. The reason is that none of these are
properties of a catalog entry: a range moves with the level, and once an item
or a talent moves it, two units holding the same ability hold two different
ranges. `AbilityView.mana_cost` already worked this way, and everything else
followed it.

The one thing that belongs to no unit is what the shop asks for a thing nobody
holds yet, so `MatchInfo` carries the price and the parts of every item once
per match, and the client prices a purchase against what the seat holds by the
same rule the server charges by. The client's own catalog is what is left over
after that: names, blurbs and art, and not one number.

`can_level` is a bit rather than a rule. The client used to hold its own copy
of "a basic ability's level k waits for hero level 2k-1, an ultimate for 6, 8
and 10" and its own subtraction of points spent from the hero level; the
server already answers all of that in `level_floor`, and answering it once is
cheaper than keeping two copies honest.

`Aim` names a fourth and fifth kind of target beyond nothing, a point and a
unit: a tree, and a spot within reach of an allied building. Both cross the
wire as a point — which one was meant is settled where the use is carried out —
but the client has to know which it is to draw the right thing under the
cursor, and saying so is one field where the alternative was a second boolean
beside the aim and a hardcoded item id in the renderer.

### Pressing a slot

A press is sent whatever state the slot is in. A passive, an ability with no
points in it, one on cooldown, an item with no charges — all of them reach the
server, and the server answers with the reason. The client gates nothing,
because every gate it could hold is a copy of a rule that already lives in
`validate_order`, and a copy that drifts turns into a press that vanishes with
no answer at all.

That puts one requirement on the server: everything `use_item` and the cast
system can refuse silently has to be named in `validate_order` first.
Otherwise the order is accepted, quietly does nothing, and the client — which
no longer holds an opinion — has nothing to show.

Both a key and a click on the box go through one function, and what a press
means is decided by a pure one that takes only the facts that settle it: which
slot, whether control is down, what is in the slot and how it is aimed, what
is already taken up, and who is commanded. Two entry points that each grew
their own rules is what the client had before — a click on an ability box did
nothing at all, and a click on an item box worked only for consumables while
its key worked for everything.

How a slot is drawn is a set of independent answers rather than one state,
because the states genuinely combine: what has no points in it is unlearned
and unusable at once, and a passive may still sit on a cooldown. Unlearned is
drawn darker than merely unusable, so the two never read as one another, and a
toggle that is on is framed in a colour the aiming frame does not use, since
that one is already the colour of a selection.

### Picking, and what carries the camera

One rule for everything that stands. A hero of one's own, an enemy hero, a
courier, a creep, a building — a click picks it, a shortcut picks it, and what
is picked is what the panel shows. There is no separate notion of picking a
seat: a seat is reached through the hero standing in it, and the panel finds
the seat behind whatever hero is picked. What is picked and what a player may
order are two questions, not one: anything at all may be looked at, and only
what this seat drives answers to the keys.

Picking never moves the camera. Reaching for the same thing twice does, and
that is the only thing a pair means: F1 twice pins the camera to one's own
hero, F2 twice to the courier, two clicks on a unit to that unit. A pair is
spent when it is made, so three presses are one pair and one single rather
than two pairs.

The camera is free otherwise. Driving it by hand — the arrows, the edge of the
screen, a click on the minimap — lets go of whatever it was pinned to, because
asking to look elsewhere is asking to stop being carried. The one exception is
the start of a match: the first hero to stand is pinned once, so a match does
not open on an empty middle of the map.

A pin holds a seat rather than a body when what it holds is a hero. A hero
that dies comes back as a new entity, and a camera pinned to the body would be
left behind by the first death and never find its way back without being told
to again.

W, A, S and D pan only for a seat with no hero to give orders to. Once there
is one, those letters are orders — A is attack-move, S is stop — and the
arrows are what is left to drive the camera by hand.

### Looking at what is not there

Two different things are not there, and they are answered in two different
places.

A hero that has fallen leaves its abilities and its items on the seat: both
outlive the body, and both are gone from the wire the moment the body is,
since they only ever rode in a `UnitView`. `PlayerView` carries them while no
body stands, under the same rule the stash goes by — told to its own side and
to nobody else. That side is the one that can act on it, and telling the other
side what a dead enemy bought while dead would be telling it more than it saw.

An enemy in the fog is the other case, and the server cannot help with it at
all: what a side may not see is what a side is not told, and that is the one
rule the whole projection is built on. So the client keeps the last state it
saw of every unit a seat owns — a handful of entries, since a seat stands in
one body at a time and a body left behind is dropped when the next one
appears. What is shown of a unit out of sight is that memory, marked with how
long ago it was true.

That memory is also the handle a fallen seat is picked by. A seat with no hero
standing has no unit on the wire, so there is nothing to name it with; the
body it left is the name. This is why picking stayed a unit and did not grow a
second form for seats: the body outlives the hero in the client's memory just
as the kit outlives it on the seat.

The panel and the popups over it read one answer, worked out once: which body
is being shown, what a fallen one left behind, and how stale it is. Two
readings of that question would drift, and the popup over a slot would end up
describing a different item from the one drawn in it.

### Tick modes

- `Realtime` — 30 Hz on the wall clock, a late command applies on the next tick.
- `Lockstep` — the server waits for `Ack(tick)` from every agent. A bot thinks as long
  as it needs, the match reproduces bit-for-bit. `--ack-timeout` guards against a hung
  bot (empty order).

## Server algorithm

```
main:
  parse args (--mode realtime|lockstep, --tick-rate, --players, --replay out.brp)
  listen TCP; the accept thread queues connections
  state = Lobby

Lobby:
  Hello → Welcome + LobbyState
  PickHero / SetReady; when every slot is ready:
    world = World::new(&cfg, cfg.rng());
    broadcast MatchStart { info: cfg.info() }; state = Playing

Playing (simulation thread):
  loop {
    // 1. gather input
    realtime: drain incoming until deadline = tick_start + 1/rate
    lockstep: wait for Ack(t) from every agent (or ack-timeout)

    // 2. validation and PlayerId → SlotId translation through Roster
    cmds = incoming
        .filter(the slot belongs to this player_id)
        .filter(world.can_see(team, target))     // anti-cheat: no clicking into fog
        .sort_by(slot, seq)
        .dedup_by(slot)                          // 1 order per slot per tick, the last one wins
    // 3. append the accepted orders to the replay
    // 4. events = world.step(&cmds)
    // 5. broadcast: teams get their view; spectators get the fogless view;
    //    events go out by Event.visible_to. The fogless frames also go into the replay
    // 6. if world.winner().is_some() { broadcast MatchOver; flush; break }
    realtime: sleep until the next tick with drift compensation
  }
```

### Order inside `world.step()`

Fixed. Changing it invalidates every recorded replay and every hash baseline.

```
1.  tick += 1
2.  apply orders → unit.order
3.  scheduled events: creep wave, neutral and hero respawns, runes
4.  status tick: buff durations, DoT, cooldowns, hp/mana regen
5.  aggro: towers and creeps pick targets by deterministic priorities
6.  order execution: movement, collision separation
7.  attacks: attack point → projectile launch / instant hit; projectile movement
8.  abilities: cast point → effect, channeling
9.  damage queue resolution: armor, magic resist, crit, block → apply
10. deaths: gold/xp by radius, respawn timers, denies
11. vision recompute, per-team fog masks
12. victory condition check
13. return the accumulated Events
```

## bota-bot

A bot that plays by rules rather than by weights, and the seam anything else would hold
a seat through. `Bot` is that seam — seated, match started, one tick in and at most one
`Ask` out, events, refusals, the end — and `play` is the loop that carries it over a
socket, written once so a second bot does not write it again. `Playbook` is the bot that
ships: `Field` reads a snapshot into a settled shape, `decide` walks a fixed list of
wants top to bottom and takes the first that answers. The whole crate is `bota-proto`
and `clap`. Float is allowed here, as it is in the client: what is recorded of a bot is
the orders it gave, not the arithmetic behind them.

**The order of the list is the whole of the judgement.** There is one order a tick, so
which want is asked first is the only priority there is: a skill point, a courier errand,
the shop, a drink, leaving while hurt, the scroll back, a spell, turning to aim one, a
last hit or a deny, striking their hero, pressing with the wave, and holding the lane.
Nothing is drawn at random and what is remembered between ticks is only what the wire
will not say twice — the attack cycle, how long the stash has been waiting, the scroll's
own clock — so the same match played twice goes the same way.

**What an ability is comes off the wire; what it does does not.** `AbilityView` carries
the level, the wait, the cost, the reach and how a cast is aimed, so nothing mirrors the
ability table by hand. What does not cross the wire is what an ability *means*, and that
is why there is a file per hero: `fiend.rs` decides when a raze is worth its mana and
`sylla.rs` when a bolt is. Prices are the same story — `MatchInfo` carries the shop, so
`Stall` reads costs and components off it and only the item **numbers** are written out,
because a salve and a ward are one shape on the wire.

**A raze is aimed by looking, not by pointing.** It lands at its own reach along the line
the caster already faces, so casting one is two decisions. `fiend_spell` works out where
each raze would land from the facing in the snapshot — the server's own octant geometry,
integer for integer, in `aim.rs` — and casts only if something worth burning is standing
there. `fiend_aim` is the other half: a mark inside the union of the three burns but off
the line gets a walk towards it, which is how a hero turns. The bands overlap, so
anything within nine hundred and fifty units can be razed by facing it.

**Buying is sequential, and the list is parts.** An order to buy a built item is refused
unless the whole of its price is in hand, while the server assembles a build the moment
its parts are in the bag — so the lists name parts, and gold is spent as it arrives.
`next_buy` stops at the first thing not owned rather than skipping to whatever is
affordable: skipping spends on the tail of a list the gold its head was saving for, which
is how a Shadow Fiend ends a match with three salves and no dagger. What is already
inside a build counts as owned, worked out by walking the components the wire gave.

**The consumables sit at the head of every list, and that is the restocking.** A stack
that is drunk stops being held, so the next walk of the list finds it wanting again and
buys another; nothing else has to know that an item was spent. The one exception to
stopping at the first thing not owned is a consumable with no working slot to go in —
what holds that up is room and not gold, so it is stepped over. `SPARE_SLOTS` keeps a
working slot clear of drink so that what is built has somewhere to land, and `tidy`
moves anything stranded in the backpack forward, since a build lands in the lowest slot
any of its parts came out of and a part bought with the bag full comes out of the
backpack.

Thirteen things were found by playing rather than by reading, and each is now a test, a
named constant, or a measurement worth not repeating.

**An order is an animation cancel.** The holding spot drifts a little every tick, and a
fresh `Move` to it every tick threw away the swing that was already winding up — fifteen
ticks of wind-up against a want resent every eight. Two rules answer it: a walk is
ordered only when the spot is more than `HOLD_SLACK` off, and a swing already ordered
holds the seat silent until it lands or `SWING_PATIENCE` runs out. Before them the bot
took two creeps in nine thousand ticks; after them, fifteen.

**Stand at the edge of your own reach.** Where to stand was reckoned off its own creeps,
which walk into the enemy wave — so the hero walked in with them and took four creeps'
worth of blows for nothing a swing from further back would not have reached. It is now
reckoned off the *nearest of theirs*, at the hero's own reach less `SWING_EDGE`.

**Swing at the worn one, not the near one.** Aiming at the nearest creep in reach changed
target whenever the wave shuffled, and a swing that keeps changing its mind never lands.
A body only ever loses health, so the lowest is the same one next tick.

**A wave in another lane is not this hero's business.** Every wave on the map is visible
and `field.creeps` counted all of them, so on the tick the first waves spawned the bot
turned round and walked home to stand behind the top lane's creeps. Creeps are now filtered
to `NEARBY` of the hero, which is also what makes "the lane is clear" mean anything.

**A tango is paid for by a tree, and a lane has none.** The forest is cleared for four
hundred and fifty units either side of a lane's centre, so a hero standing where it farms
never has one within the hundred and sixty-five a tango reaches. The bot carried three
charges up the lane and ate one in a whole match, then walked the length of the map to
heal at the fountain instead — some eight hundred ticks a trip, four or five trips a
match. Walking to the tree is now part of eating the tango, and only to trees no further
up the lane than the hero already stands. `MENDED_RETURN` finishes the thought: a hero a
mend is already carrying turns round early rather than walking a trip the mend has
already paid for.

**The lane is held by talking to the creeps, not by standing somewhere.** An attack order
does something to everybody who is not the one giving it, and the order alone does it,
whether the attack ever happens or not: aimed at an enemy hero it calls every enemy creep
within its own acquisition of the orderer onto him for `AGGRO_HOLD` ticks, and aimed at
one of your own it makes them pick again with him put last. Two wants come out of that.
`pull` gives the first when the wave has been pushed more than `PULL_DRIFT` past where it
should meet: standing behind its own line, the hero is a spot their creeps must walk past
that line to reach, and the fight comes back down the lane with them. `shake` gives the
second when creeps are chewing on the hero, aimed at the nearest of its own creeps.

It was aimed at the hero itself first, and that was a hole in the rule rather than a use
of it. A hero is on its own side, so `call_of` read a self-click as letting go, and the
server would not let the swing land either — which made it a free aggro drop that cost
not even a step. Dota has no such click. `rouse_bystanders` now turns away an order whose
mark is the one who gave it, and the test for it needs a hero already swinging at one of
the creep's own: `threat_priority` ranks an idle hero below a creep, so with nobody
swinging the creep was never on the hero and there was nothing to demote. Pointing at a
creep instead costs the follow that pointing at a unit always costs, so the tick after a
shake the hero is told to stand — and that tick must not itself count as a shake, or
every tick is the tick after one and the hero stands still for good.

Given to one side only, `pull` is worth four and a half last hits and four tenths of a
level to the side that does it, and it is the only change so far that moved the hero's
own farm rather than moving it between the two seats. What it trades is denies, which
fall for both — a wave held near your own tower is a wave the other side is not pushing
into, and there is less of it left low enough to put out. `shake` fires three times in a
match and measures as nothing: standing at the edge of its own reach, the bot is in range
of one ranged creep and no melee ones, so there is rarely a wave on it to shake. It is
kept for what it costs, which is a tick, and for the heroes with less reach that will
come.

**A held body is not the seat's to spend a tick on.** `StatusFlags` carries both the stun
and the channel, so the ladder stops at the top for either: an order given during a
channel is how the channel is thrown away, which the bot was doing to its own scroll
eleven times a match.

**Nothing is on a list that no want reaches for.** Shadow Fiend's list ended in a Blink
Dagger, two thousand two hundred and fifty gold and a working slot for an item no rung of
the ladder ever names — the same fault as the scroll, caught the same way and worth
looking for whenever a list grows. It ends in a Broadsword now, which the swing
arithmetic does read.

**What limits the last hitting is not the swing.** Over one match Shadow Fiend committed
a swing to fifty-three creeps and took thirty-seven of them, so seven attempts in ten
land; what it does not do is attempt, on a hundred and sixty creeps that spawn either
side. Two ways of buying more damage into that were tried and both measured worse over
five seeds, each read on the pair's total rather than one hero's line:

| | pair, last hits and denies |
|---|---|
| as it stands | 76.4 |
| a Quelling Blade for both | 70.8 |
| a Quelling Blade for one side only | Shadow Fiend 41.8, from 48.0 |
| standing a hundred and sixty inside reach rather than forty | 67.0 |

Eighteen more damage against creeps widens the window a swing is worth taking in, and
the bot then commits earlier and holds its target through `SWING_PATIENCE` while the
creep is taken from under it; standing closer reaches more of the wave and buys four
creeps' worth of blows for it. Neither is a knob to turn until the thing that is actually
short — ticks spent standing where the wave is dying — is shorter.

**A mend spent on a walk to the fountain is a mend the fountain was about to make
free.** The bot ate tangoes on its way home — eight of them in one match, and five
hundred ticks of detours to the trees that paid for them — for a hundred and fifteen
health over sixteen seconds, while walking towards something that gives twenty-five a
tick and asks nothing. A mend is now weighed against the walk that has already been
decided on: while the hero is pulling out, it is spent only if it would carry it back
over `MENDED_RETURN`, which a salve's four hundred does and a tango's hundred and fifteen
usually does not. `mind_health` was split out of the walk itself so the flag is settled
before the drink is weighed rather than after. Eight wasted tangoes became none, the
detours five hundred ticks became forty, and the time spent walking home fell by a fifth.

**A scroll bought and never spent.** The want asked the hero to be standing in its own
shop, which is where a scroll is bought and nowhere it ever needs to be — a scroll
constrains where it is *aimed*, not where it is cast from, and the bot with its drink and
its courier had stopped going home at all: eleven ticks inside the shop radius in a
twenty-four-thousand-tick match. Two more things had to give before it fired. It now
carries both ways, home while hurt and back into the lane once mended, and it sits above
the walk home rather than below it, since what that walk is for is the thing a scroll
does in three seconds. `SPARE_SLOTS` was the last of it: at one it stopped restocking any
consumable once five items were held, so the one scroll spent was never replaced. At
nought a consumable is bought whenever a working slot is free, and `tidy` carries what
that costs. Six casts a match now, one about every four thousand ticks, which is the
shared wait and not the policy.

Reading a one-in-ten trace to decide whether an item is used at all is how three of those
were missed: a cast is one tick and the replacement is bought on the next, so the bag
looks untouched at every sample. `Playbook` keeps the name of the rung that answered and
the trace prints it; counting those over every tick is the measurement that settled it.

**Mana was short because nothing was ever bought for it.** A raze costs the better part
of a hundred against a pool that mends about two a second, and the bot had the code to
drink a clarity but no clarity on any list, and a wand it never pressed — a wand holds
twenty charges worth fifteen of each pool, which is three razes in one keystroke. Both
are now on the ladder, and Shadow Fiend buys a Sage's Mask where he used to buy a Wraith
Band. Over five seeds the mask is a wash on the scoreboard — 26.8 last hits to the band's
25.6, inside the noise of five matches — and it is kept for costing a hundred and
seventy-five where the band cost five hundred and five, which leaves a working slot for
the drink rather than a third stat item.

What it does not do: it will not dive a tower, leave its lane to gank, stack or pull a
camp, place a ward, or fight for a rune. It takes buildings only by walking up with its
own wave. Two bots of it play a full match to an Ancient: seventy-five thousand ticks in
the run this was written from, both seats at the level cap, a hundred and fifty-two last
hits to fifty-one denies on the winning side, and no order refused on either. How long a
match runs moves a great deal with the ruleset — it was a hundred and thirteen thousand
before towers and flagbearers handed anything out, since a wave that lives longer is a
wave that pushes. The same seed run twice gives the same numbers down to the order count.

The two heroes trade places on the scoreboard with almost every change to the ladder,
and the pair's total farm barely moves: they are the same policy on both sides of one
lane, so whichever gets a little ahead denies the other and the lead compounds. Read the
two seats added together, over several seeds; a swing in one of them alone is the lane
tipping, not the change working.

## bota-bot, as it was: a bot that weighed candidates

The three sections below describe the two bots that were moved out of this repository.
They are kept for the reasoning in them — the self-play harness, the lessons, the
breeding search — and none of it describes code that is here now.

```rust
pub trait Bot {
    fn seated(&mut self, slot: Option<SlotId>);
    fn match_started(&mut self, info: &MatchInfo);
    fn on_tick(&mut self, view: &WorldView) -> Option<Order>;
    fn on_events(&mut self, _tick: u32, _events: &[EventKind]) {}
    fn on_reject(&mut self, _seq: u32, _reason: RejectReason) {}
    fn finished(&mut self, _winner: Team, _stats: &MatchStats) {}
}

pub fn play<B: Bot>(bot: &mut B, seat: &Seat) -> io::Result<Outcome>;
```

The hero is picked when the connection is made rather than returned from a callback:
picking happens in the lobby, before there is a `MatchInfo` to decide from.

`on_events` earns its place. The attack cycle is not on the wire — a `UnitView` carries
`attack_interval` but not where in the interval a unit stands — so a bot cannot tell
whether it may swing now or in forty ticks. What is on the wire is every blow that
lands: one of the bot's own says the cycle began a wind-up ago and comes round again an
interval after that. Without this the bot orders last hits it cannot take for another
second and loses them all.

### One order a tick, and saying nothing

The server keeps one order per seat per tick and the last one wins, so a want is a
single `Order` and the policy ranks its wants rather than queueing them. Re-sending the
want already standing is not free: an order cancels the recovery after a swing and calls
the creeps onto whoever gave it. So a want equal to the one in hand is not sent again
for `resend_ticks`, and two walks to spots less than `resend_drift` apart count as one
want — otherwise following a moving wave throws away the route the server laid every
tick.

### The courier

A courier is what makes the shopping list past the first trip worth having: anything
bought away from the shop falls into a stash the hero cannot reach from the lane, so
without one the only way to spend gold is to walk home for it. With one, the bot buys
wherever it stands — and only while a courier of its own is standing, because gold in
hand is worth more than an item in a stash nothing is coming for.

The errands are abilities the courier carries, so an order for one names the courier in
`ClientMsg::Order`'s `unit` and casts the slot the errand sits in. Which slot that is, is
read off the courier rather than assumed: the order the server fills its book in is the
server's business. A `Want` therefore carries whom it is for, and what the bot answers
with each tick is an `Ask` — an order and a unit — rather than an order alone.

An errand outlives the tick it was given in. Saying it again changes nothing about what
the courier does and costs the one order the seat has that tick, which is an order the
hero did not get to give: the first cut of this sent five hundred and thirty-six errands
in one match, and the hero took a quarter more damage for want of the ticks. So an errand
already under way is not repeated until `courier_repeat` ticks have passed, which is a
safety net for an order that never arrived rather than a schedule.

A trip is not made for one item: it waits until `courier_batch` of them have piled up or
the first has waited `courier_patience` ticks. And it is held back entirely while the bot
is being shot at — a courier walks to where its owner stands, and where its owner stands
is what is shooting.

An errand answers to what the courier is carrying, not only to what waits in the
stash. Sent for a stash that is empty while already holding something, it takes what it
holds on to its owner rather than flying home with it: a courier that comes to be
carrying goods it could not hand over would otherwise be sent home by the very key
meant to bring them, and the goods would ride back and forth for ever. And what an
owner has no room for is carried back to the stash rather than kept aboard, so a full
bag leaves the goods somewhere its owner can reach them rather than orbiting the lane.

Delivery also collects: having handed its load over, the courier takes every stack the
owner has marked for sale, and the put-back leg it already flies carries them to the
stash, where the sale pass cashes them. A courier with nothing to deliver still answers
the call while something is marked — the call is the ask, and refusing it would leave
marked goods stranded on a hero who cannot reach the shop.

A courier brought down keeps its load. The stacks wait on the seat while the courier is
gone and come back aboard the next one, the same way a fallen hero's bag waits on the
seat. Spilling the load on the ground was considered and turned down: the wait already
prices the death, the goods staying out of reach until the courier stands again is
punishment enough, and a bot that loses items outright learns to fear the courier
rather than to use it.

A way found round something is walked to the spot it was found for, and the spot it
was found for is what is kept beside it. Keeping the last spot asked for instead is what
made a courier fly the whole of a stale way to where its owner used to stand: a quarry
that moves a little every tick never moves far enough in one tick to look like a new
goal, so the way was never found again until its last corner had been reached. And a way
round anything is found only for what walks. What flies is over all of it, so it is
pointed straight at where it is going and keeps no route at all.

Walking at something that cannot be struck — an ally, most often, since an order aimed
at one is how creeps are shaken off — closes until the bodies touch and stops there,
following it for as long as the order stands. Aiming at the middle of a body instead is
aiming at a spot inside it, which cannot be reached: the walk presses in, the pass that
eases overlapping bodies apart pushes back out, and the two together read on the screen
as circling. Stopping a hair outside the hulls keeps that pass out of it entirely.

### The numbers held apart from the decisions

Every threshold the policy weighs — how low is low, how far is far, how many ticks a
swing takes to land — is a field of `Params` with a range, not a constant at the place
that reads it. Three things follow: a run can be handed a set from a file, a search can
walk over the set, and the numbers standing for what the wire does not carry (the wind-up,
the arrow's speed, what an ability reaches) are tuned the same way as the numbers standing
for taste. `Params` is `f32` throughout: the bot is allowed float, and uniform fields are
what let a search treat the set as a vector without a case per field.

A trained set lives in `params.txt` **beside the repository, not inside it**, and is not
committed. Weights are the same, in `weights.safetensors`. Both are read when the bot runs
rather than carried inside the binary, so a training run takes effect without a rebuild
and a machine without one plays by the numbers the code was written with.

They are not committed because of what they are. A set of numbers is what one machine's
training run happened to arrive at over a few hours against one opponent — it is an
artefact of a run, not a statement about the game, and the run that produced it is
reproducible from its seed. Committing it would put a binary blob in review that nobody
can read and everybody would have to merge.

Two sets, and the difference matters:

| | What it is | Who plays by it |
|---|---|---|
| `Params::default()` | the numbers the code was written with | the tests, `--plain`, and any machine with no kept file |
| `Params::learned()` | `params.txt` as it is on disk now | `Brain::new()`, `play`, and `train` as its starting point |

The tests pin the policy against `default()`, never against a trained set: what a test
measures is the decision, and a trained set is data that moves under it. What a test does
hold is the round trip — a knob renamed leaves an old file naming something nothing is
called, and a bot that quietly fell back to the plain numbers would play worse for no
visible reason.

### Self-play

Training is `bota-bot train`, and it needs nothing the server does not already do. A
server plays one match and exits, so a bout starts one on a port the system picks, joins
both seats, and kills it with the bout. Joining waits for the seat: seats go out in the
order the server sees connections arrive, two connections made back to back arrive in
whichever order the threads behind them run, and a set that played the same side twice is
measured against a side rather than against an opponent. That was a real bug and it made
every measurement bimodal. Lockstep is what makes it
worth doing: the server advances as soon as every seat has acknowledged the tick, so a
match runs as fast as the two brains think — twelve thousand ticks, a little under seven
minutes of game, in about three seconds. A bot that does **not** acknowledge holds the
match at the straggler timeout, one tick at a time.

The search is a (1+λ). A round breeds several challengers out of the set in hand, each
differing in a few numbers, and measures every one of them the same way: two matches
against a champion, one from each side. Whichever came out furthest ahead of the champion
takes the set in hand, if it came out further ahead than that set did. Both sides are
played because the map is not symmetric to a search: left to one side it would learn the
side rather than the game. The matches of a round are independent, so they run at once — a
round costs two matches of wall clock, not fourteen.

Measuring against a champion rather than head to head against the set in hand is what
makes a round mean something. Head to head, the thing being climbed moves under the search
every time it takes a step: a challenger that beat the set in hand says nothing about the
round before it, the number in the journal drifts, and a run of them walks rather than
climbs. That was tried first and it is what it did — twenty rounds of taking challengers
left the set no better against a fixed opponent than it started. Against something frozen,
better is one number that means the same in the first round and the hundredth.

The champion is frozen, not fixed: it starts as the numbers the code was written with and
the best set replaces it every `champion_every` rounds, so the bar rises. A search
measured against one weak opponent forever learns to beat that opponent.

How far a nudge reaches is not fixed either. It widens while more than a fifth of the
challengers beat the set in hand and narrows while fewer do: a search that keeps failing
is reaching too far, and one that nearly always succeeds is not reaching far enough. A
fifth is the old rule of thumb. What matters about it is that both halves happen —
widening on any success at all only ever widens, which is the same as not adapting.

What is scored is mostly what the seat did — creeps taken, creeps denied, levels, gold,
damage put on the other hero and damage taken — because two even bots farm for twenty
minutes and neither Ancient falls; the win itself outweighs any of it when it does come.
The damage is counted from `EventKind::Damaged` rather than read from `MatchStats`: the
final numbers arrive only when a match runs to its end, a match played for a fixed span
never does, and the server reports `hero_damage` as zero besides. Without those two columns
the whole fighting half of the policy is unconstrained — every match ends nought kills to
nought, so nothing else in the score can tell a bot that harasses from a bot that does not.

Nothing about this reaches into `bota-server`: the trainer is a process that starts other
processes, and the bot still sees only what its own side may see. A search that could see
through the fog would learn to.

`Watched` writes a line a tick — where it stood, what it had, what was near, and the order
it gave. It is what a match is read back from without watching it, and it is the shape a
policy learned from recorded play would be trained on.

### The second bot: a network that chooses

There are two bots in the crate and they share everything but the choosing. The
rule-driven one weighs its wants in a fixed order and takes the first that answers. The
other draws up the same wants, scores each with a network, and takes the highest.

Scoring candidates rather than emitting an action is what makes a network fit this game
at all. An order is parameterised — walk *there*, hit *that one* — so a fixed row of N
action classes cannot name the action space, and a head that regresses a position has to
learn from scratch that positions off the lane are worthless. Scoring sidesteps both:
which orders exist stays with the code that knows the rules, the number of them is free
to change from tick to tick, and the same weights judge a swing at one creep and a swing
at another.

A row shown to the network is the tick and one candidate laid end to end — twenty-four
numbers about the world, thirty-two about the candidate, every one of them brought to
about the same size. Two hidden layers of a hundred and twenty-eight, one number out:
some twenty-four thousand weights. The library is behind one file, `net/model.rs`, so
what the bot decides does not depend on which tensor crate is underneath.

### Teaching it, in two halves

**Copying first.** A network started from nothing spends a very long time discovering
that walking into a tower is bad, and every match costs seconds. It does not have to:
there is already a bot that plays a respectable lane, and every order it gives is an
answer to a question the network will be asked. So the first half is not a search at all.
Play matches, write down the candidates and which was taken, and move the weights until
the network takes the same one. Thirty-one thousand decisions and four passes — about a
minute — gets it agreeing with the rules **87%** of the time, and playing level with them.
Chance is one in twenty-four.

How faithful the copy is turns out to decide everything. Thirty-one thousand decisions
and four passes gets 87% agreement, and a network that agrees seven times in eight plays
*worse* than what it copied — errors compound, and a lane is unforgiving. Sixty-two
thousand and ten passes gets **92.6%**, and that one plays better than what it copied. The
gap between those two runs is the difference between a second bot that is a curiosity and
one that is worth keeping.

That the candidate list holds what the rule bot chose is checked and reported rather than
assumed: **98.7%** of its orders are candidates the network could have picked. Whatever is
short of that is behaviour the network cannot be taught, and a number that drops after a
change to either bot says so.

**Practising second.** Copying cannot beat what it copied. The second half plays the
network against **a frozen greedy copy of itself** on the same seed — one side wandering,
one side taking what it already believes — and moves the weights towards the wandering
choices of matches where wandering paid.

The frozen side is the whole trick, and it was learned the hard way. The first cut scored
each seat against the average of the generation, which sounds reasonable and is nearly
noise: both seats play the same weights, so half of them come out above average whatever
they did. Sharpening towards those halves sharpens randomness, and it showed — over five
rounds the loss fell from 0.121 to 0.057 while the matches got *worse*, 44 down to 33. A
policy agreeing with itself ever harder looks exactly like a policy learning. Against a
side that made no unusual choices on the same seed, the difference is what the unusual
choices were worth, which is the thing being asked.

**Measure against something that does not move.** The second thing learned the hard way,
and the same lesson the search over the numbers taught: a round's own matches are worth
whatever their seeds were worth, so reading that number as progress is reading the luck of
the draw. Every fifth round the network plays the rule-driven bot greedily, on the same
handful of seeds every time, from both sides. That margin is the only number in a run that
means the same thing in the first round and the last — and it is what showed that the 87%
copy was twenty-odd points *behind* while its own matches looked fine. From the better
copy, which starts level and a little ahead, the margin climbs: +17 at five rounds, +26 at
ten. The share of wandering that pays falls as it goes, from three quarters towards a
third, which is what a policy absorbing its own good accidents looks like.

Two smaller things keep it honest. Each seed is played twice with the sides swapped, so
nothing learned is a fact about which end of the map a seat began at. And a slice of what
was copied is gone over again every round: a policy taught only from its own recent
matches forgets the parts of the game those matches did not visit, and there is nothing
in a lane to remind it.

The weights are kept in `weights.safetensors` beside the repository, on the same rule as
the numbers: read when the bot runs, not committed, not carried inside the binary. Asked to
play by weights that are not there, the bot says so rather than playing something else.

Credit inside a match is handed out per decision: what followed it over the next while,
discounted so the near future counts for most of it, judged against what other decisions
taken at about the same point in a match were worth. Early ticks pay little and late ticks
pay much whatever is chosen, so comparing against the run of all decisions would only be
measuring the clock.

Whether that is better than giving every decision the match's score is **not settled**. Run
against run from the same weights and seed, the blunt scheme reached +23.4 against the rule
bot and the per-decision scheme +23.6 — a tie. What the per-decision scheme did need before
it could even tie was a fix to something else: the network used to write down a decision on
every tick, including the thousands where it was standing by what it had already said.
Those frames are near-duplicates of their neighbours, their returns differ by noise, and
learning the difference is learning nothing. Recording only the ticks that actually issue an
order — which is what watching the rule bot always did — cut the frames fivefold and brought
the scheme from +17.6 back to parity.

### Two bots can each be better than the other

The net that came out of that run is +35.8 against the rule bot, the best measured, and
−4.6 against the clone it was itself trained from, losing every match. Both verdicts are
twenty matches with the doubt on them under five.

This is not a contradiction to be explained away. Practising against a frozen copy of
oneself is training to beat *that opponent*, and a policy can get better at one style while
getting worse against another. It means a single number cannot say which of two bots is
stronger — only which is stronger against what it was measured on. The honest fix is a pool
of opponents rather than one, which the arena is already shaped for; until then, a verdict
here should always be read with its opponent named.

A forward model (rolling out hypothetical futures for planning) is not supported and
not needed now: the bot has no hidden state, so it could not roll forward with the
real engine anyway. If it becomes needed, the simulation moves out of `bota-server`
into its own crate, which is cheap since `sim/` is already a separate subtree with no
dependencies on the network layer.

### Playing without a socket

Most of a match is not the match. Measured on one match of twenty thousand ticks: the world
itself steps in 231 ms, projecting it through the fog for both sides costs 46 ms, the model
decides in 3363 ms — and the remaining 5812 ms is postcard, TCP, two processes and the
lockstep acks between them. Three per cent of the wall clock is the game.

So `bota-bot-v2` can play its matches in its own process. All of that lives in one module,
`bench.rs`, which is the only place in the bot that names `bota-server` at all; the server
is not changed for it and does not know it exists. A bench hands over the view of that
seat's own side, fog and all, which is byte for byte what the socket would have carried.
Reading the world directly would be faster still and would train a bot that cannot play,
having learned on what a seat is never shown.

The dependency is behind the `builtin` feature, so a bot built without it carries no
simulation. That the bot could reach further into `bota-server` than `bench.rs` does is a
matter of one module's discipline rather than of the compiler's — the cost of not bending
the server around the bot.

There is one seat loop, not two. `play_on` takes anything that answers three questions —
hear, order, done thinking — and a socket and a chair both do. Two loops would part company
by the second change to either, and then the model would be trained on one game and played
on another.

The gain is real and smaller than it looks from the breakdown: **about a quarter**, not the
two and a half times the numbers above suggest. The server's share of that 5812 ms runs on
another core, in parallel with the bot's thinking, so removing it does not remove wall clock
one for one. What it does remove is a process and a socket per match, which is what matters
once there are more lanes than cores.

Two things had to be got exactly right, and both were found by comparing the two paths on
the same seeds rather than by reading the code.

**A tick waits for every seat that is still there.** The seats' acks started life meaning
"has thought about everything", so a seat that had not spoken yet did not hold the tick and
the world walked on without it. The match still ran, and still repeated itself when run
twice in a row, which is what made it look right.

**There is no snapshot of the tick a match begins on.** The server gathers orders, advances,
and only then sends, so the first snapshot a seat ever sees is of tick one. An arena that
handed out tick zero put every seat a tick ahead of itself for the whole match. The first
three lessons agreed to the mark either way — they are short — and everything from three
thousand ticks on drifted apart.

With both fixed, one model scored identically on all seven lessons down to the last tenth,
by both paths. That equality is the whole warrant for training on the fast one.

### Hanging up

A connection is closed one half at a time: the writer shuts down the sending side and
leaves the receiving side open. Closing both while the peer still has bytes of ours in
flight resets the connection, and a reset discards what was already sent — so the peer
loses the message saying who won and sees an aborted socket instead of a result. It cost
an afternoon to find, because the seat reported it as a connection error at a tick number
that looked like a length limit.

Two things around it are part of the same lesson. The server waits for its writer threads
rather than exiting from under them, since the last message of a match is queued at the
moment the server has nothing left to do. And a harness that starts a server reads its
error output rather than discarding it: thrown away, a server that panics reaches the
caller as a socket that closed, naming neither the server nor the panic.

## bota-bot-v2

A second bot, built the other way round. The first one weighs candidates the rules drew
up; this one is handed a fixed vector and a fixed numbered list of deeds, and names one.
Nothing of the first is reused: a bot that depended on another would mean every future bot
carrying every past one about with it.

The whole contract is four pieces.

| | |
|---|---|
| `field.rs` | one tick read into a settled shape: who is who, in what order, seen from where |
| `sight.rs` | **188 numbers** built from that |
| `deed.rs` | **126 deeds**, flat and numbered |
| `doing.rs` | which of them may be done now, and what a chosen number turns into |
| `marks.rs` | what a tick is worth, lesson by lesson |

Between the numbers and the choice sits a `Mind`: handed numbers and flags, answers with
one number. That is the whole seam. A mind that knows what a creep is has reached across
it, and a game that knows what a weight is has reached back.

### Why the reading of a tick is its own piece

Because the vector and the decoder have to agree about which creep is the third one. Read
the tick twice and they drift, and every hour of training above them is learning noise.
For the same reason the order has a tie-break on the handle: two creeps the same distance
off would otherwise swap places from tick to tick, and the number that named one would
name the other.

### Turned about

Forward is always towards the other side's fountain and left is always left of that. In
world coordinates a bot would learn the game twice, once from each corner of a map that is
a mirror of itself.

### Legality is ours, not the model's

Every tick carries a flag per deed. The model never picks one that is false — the numbers
of the impossible are sent to nothing before anything is compared, so they can never come
out on top and never carry a gradient. Letting it pick freely and taking the points off
afterwards was considered and dropped: there is one order a tick, so a wasted pick is a
lost creep, and what is legal is known to us for nothing.

The counting goes both ways, and it earned its keep immediately. The first match run this
way had the model choose nothing illegal — and the **server refuse eleven hundred of its
orders out of eight thousand**. What the bot believed about legality and what the server
enforced were not the same thing: a snapshot carries an ability's level and its wait but
not whether it can be cast at all or what it must be aimed at, and the bot was offering
casts of passives and bolts aimed at the ground. With that written down in `spells.rs` the
refusals went to nought. A bot that had only counted its own mask would have called itself
correct and quietly thrown away one tick in eight.

### What of the ground made it into the list

Of the item orders the wire grew later, the list took only selling: one deed per
inventory slot, marking far out and cashing at the shop, so the whole trip is the sell
deed plus the deliver errand it already had. Laying an item down and taking one up are
not deeds. In selfplay nothing ever lies on the ground — a courier keeps its load
through death and no deed drops anything — so a take-deed would be a logit that is
masked on every tick of every match, and a put-deed a way to burn a tick and half an
item's price. The list is append-only exactly so that either can be added the day
something puts loot on the ground in front of a bot.

**Selling is legal only at the shop.** The wire sells from anywhere: away from the
shop the order lays a mark, and the shop settles the mark whenever the stack reaches
it — walked home, or collected by the courier's next delivery leg. For a model that is
nine deeds, always legal, free to toggle, and paid for hundreds of ticks after the
choice at half price by a route it never asked for; the bred crowds duly chose them as
noise and bled by them. Masked to the shop's reach, a sale moves gold and goods on the
tick it is chosen, which is a price a selection can see. The mask is the bot's own:
the wire and the mark are unchanged, and a human still sells from anywhere.

**A swap is the model's own choice.** The list long held no way to move an item: `Use`
and `Sell` reach the working slots alone, so a stack the courier set down in the
backpack, or one waiting in the stash while its owner stood at the shop, was out of
the game for good — whole matches were played with a wraith band asleep in the stash
and a magic stick working in its place. One deed per pair now: every spare slot — the
backpack, then the stash — against every worn one, fifty-four in all, legal while
either side holds something, the stash taking part only at the shop, which is the
server's own rule. Whichever side is full moves onto the other; both full is the swap
it says. A single "wear the best" deed with the valuation ours, the way `Buy`'s is,
was considered and passed over: which item earns a working slot turns on charges,
waits and the fight at hand, which is exactly the judgement being bred. What was added
to the choice had to be added to the eye: the worn slots now show what each item cost,
and the backpack and the stash show themselves at all — a spare slot is a presence and
a price, where before the model saw only how many things were waiting. Sight grows 164
numbers to 188 and the list 72 deeds to 126; weights trained before either do not
load, which is the standing rule for both.

### The model

One head over one trunk of two layers: a number per deed. Some **435 thousand weights**
against the first bot's twenty-four.

A value head — one number for what the position is worth, whatever is chosen — sat
beside the policy while lessons were taught by gradient. Judging a single decision needs
something to judge it against, and the first bot's home-made baselines — the match's own
score, then the average of decisions at the same point on the clock — were measured
against each other and came out a tie; a learned value was the answer the tie was
pointing at. Breeding judges whole matches and expects nothing of a position, so the
head went with the trainer that needed it. Old weight files still load: weights are
looked up by name, and a value head in the file is simply never asked for.

It is shown seven ticks laid end to end rather than only the newest, because a swing that
has begun, a creep about to die and a creep just dead look alike in one frame. Frames
rather than a memory of its own: a memory carried through twelve thousand ticks and reset
on every death costs more to train than that is worth. If a measured gap ever asks for
recurrence, the seam is the place to put it and nothing above or below would notice.

**The frames are spaced by doubling ages, not taken consecutively.** Half a second back,
then one, two, four, eight and sixteen seconds, and the tick being decided on. Four
consecutive ticks reached an eighth of a second, which is enough to see a swing land and
nothing else: whether a wave is being pushed, whether the other hero has been closing for
the last ten seconds, whether the bot has been standing in the same place since it walked
there — all of it happens on a scale the old window could not reach. Doubling buys a
quarter of a minute for three more frames, at the price of resolution the far end does not
need.

**Ages are the match's own ticks, not how many times the model was asked.** The seat
chooses nothing while there is nothing to choose, which is mostly being dead, so counting
calls would let a death quietly stretch a sixteen-second window into a minute. Each frame
is the newest tick seen at or before its age, so a gap reads as the last thing the seat
actually saw rather than sliding the other frames along. One frame from beyond the window
is kept for exactly that reason — after a long gap the oldest age asks for a tick older
than the window itself.

The price is three more frames on the first layer: `INPUT` goes from `NUMBERS x 4` to
`NUMBERS x 7`, 624 numbers to 1092, and the model from 240441 weights to 360249. It bought
them for nothing. A forward pass measured 23.5 us before and 22.5 us after — half again as
many weights and no more time, because at a batch of one the pass is bound by the ten
candle operations it is made of and not by the arithmetic inside them. The same reason a
GPU would lose here is the reason this was free.

Weights trained against the old input cannot be loaded against the new one, and are not
silently reshaped: `shape mismatch in set, lhs: [1092, 256], rhs: [624, 256]`, and the
load fails.

### Lessons

A match pays almost nothing almost all of the time, so the bot is not asked to learn the
game at once. Seven lessons, each a longer match than the last, each paid for something
narrower than winning.

| | ticks | scored in |
|---|---|---|
| stock up | 300 | `marks/stock_up.rs` |
| find the lane | 900 | `marks/find_the_lane.rs` |
| hold the lane | 1200 | `marks/hold_the_lane.rs` |
| meet the wave | 3000 | `marks/meet_the_wave.rs` |
| work the lane | 12600 | `marks/work_the_lane.rs` |
| take the towers | 36000 | `marks/take_the_towers.rs` |
| grow rich | 54000 | `marks/grow_rich.rs` |

**A lesson is one file and one function.** How long it runs is its row of `LADDER`; what it
pays for is the file that row names, weights and all. `score` is the only place in the
crate that branches on which lesson is being taught, and it does nothing but hand the tick
to that lesson's own function. There used to be seven such branches, spread over standing,
walking, blows, buying and fighting, and reading what one lesson was worth meant reading
all of them.

**A lesson is scored once a tick.** The seat holds a tick's events until the next snapshot
says what the tick came to, then scores it whole. Two entry points — one for the snapshot,
one for the events — would force every lesson to be cut in half along a seam that is the
wire's, not the lesson's.

**A lesson's marks are its own.** Nothing a lesson pays for depends on what an earlier one
taught. Lessons used to keep a quarter of the habit before them, and it was measured not to
work: at the last rung a quarter of the shopping habit is one mark against three hundred,
which no selection can see, and every bred model had forgotten how to shop by the end of
the ladder. Rescaling the quarter would have been a knob to guess; dropping it is one less
thing that can be wrong.

Isolated marks are also readable all at once, which is how they are now read. One match,
run to the longest lesson's clock, is scored by every lesson: each counts the ticks inside
its own window and stops. The whole ladder for the price of its longest rung, and a card
that describes one game rather than seven different ones.

The last rung is net worth itself — unspent gold plus what everything owned cost — paid a
tick at a time as the difference since the tick before, which adds up to what the seat
ended up worth less what it started with. Downwards as well, so gold lost on dying is net
worth lost. One mark a gold, which puts the number an order of magnitude above every other
lesson's; that is harmless because a lesson's marks are never added to another's, and it
means the number reported is net worth and not a scaled shadow of it.

Four decisions inside the marks were settled by measuring, each after a run that learned
nothing or learned the wrong thing.

**No flat floor.** Nearness was a straight slope from full marks at six hundred units to
nothing at three thousand. Past three thousand every position scored the same nothing, so a
bot that had wandered off had nothing in the numbers pointing home. It is now a falloff
that halves at six hundred and never reaches zero.

**Not the line — the spot.** The first lane lesson paid for standing near the line its lane
runs along. A fountain is on that line. Doing nothing whatsoever scored 8.9 out of a ceiling
of 9.0; the lesson now pays for the spot halfway along, where the waves meet.

**Ground closed, not ground left.** Paid for nearness alone, the same lesson stuck at 0.5
out of 9.0 for thirty rounds: a random walk cannot cross most of a lane in thirty seconds,
and until it does, nothing it does changes what it is paid. Marks go to the distance
*closed* since the last tick, which pays from the first step in the right direction. With
that the lesson went 3.6 to 10.0 in ten rounds.

**Blows count only against the other side.** Paid for the swing alone, the gradient trainer
found what the wording allowed and went all the way into it: nought enemy creeps killed a
match and twenty-four of its own, because its own wave is always beside it and never fights
back. Closing the wording moved the same trainer from nought last hits to fifty-three and
from twenty-four denies to none.

The last rung pays for four things at once: damage to their towers, a tower falling,
killing them, and staying whole, with dying counted against it. A tower is worth more the
earlier it falls, by a falloff that halves at five minutes, and worth more for every one
already taken, so the second is twice the first. Two departures from the plain reading of
"damage over time, times towers taken": multiplying the whole score by the towers taken
makes every point of damage before the first tower worth exactly nothing, which is the flat
plateau again, so damage pays on its own and the multiplier applies to the towers alone;
and dividing by the clock makes a tower taken in the first seconds worth unboundedly more
than one taken a minute in, so a falloff is used instead. Health and mana are paid for only
outside its own base — paid wherever it stood, the surest route to full health, full mana
and no deaths at all is never to leave the fountain.

Spending is read off what the seat owns — the bag, the stash and the courier's load, each
item at its price — rather than off the gold falling, which also falls on death and rises
on its own. Only increases count; selling gold back is not spending it.

### Grow strong

The eighth rung is worth on a sliding count: gold at its face value, goods at half as
much again while they ride in the backpack, the stash or the courier's load, and at
twice their cost once they sit in the working slots. Every step a gold takes towards
being worn pays: one for earning it, half an item's price over the gold for buying it,
and the other half when it is worn rather than carried.

It exists because **`grow rich` cannot tell hoarding from wearing.** Net worth counts the
purse at face value, so buying a five-hundred item moves five hundred from one side of the
sum to the other and the number does not move. Two hands that end a match on the same net
worth score identically, whether one of them is wearing it and the other sitting on it —
and one of those two is a hero and the other is a wallet. A test asserts exactly that gap:
the same five hundred, `grow rich` paying both hands alike and `grow strong` paying the one
that wears it twice as much.

That `grow rich` will *eventually* reward spending is true and useless. Items win fights,
fights win farm, farm is net worth — but that is four causal steps, and a breeding search
that gets one number per match will not find it. The half is a direct signal for what the
long chain only implies.

**Carried is not worn.** The first cut counted the purse at half and every item at its
face wherever it sat, which told buying from hoarding and nothing else: boots asleep in
the stash scored the same as boots working on the hero, and the whole trip that turns
gold into stats — buy, send, fetch, wear — was paid in full at its first step and never
again. The count now steps one, one and a half, two, so buying and wearing each pay
half the price, and the delivery in between is what the wearing half is paid for.

**Gold at its face, not at a half.** The half-purse made a last hit worth half of what
`grow rich` says it is and a death cost half of what it costs, and earning is not the
habit being taught out — hoarding is, and hoarding is already what the multipliers
above the purse pay against. At face value the two lessons agree about income and
death, and differ exactly where this one exists to differ: what became of the gold.

**A consumable is worth what it does.** Counted like a durable it is a dead loss to
use: a salve in the working slots counts two hundred and twenty, and drinking it wipes
that out. The crowds bred on that counting did the arithmetic — they bought salves,
marked them for sale and never drank one. So health mended on the seat's own hero pays
a mark a point and mana half a mark, read off the `Healed` events the server now emits
when something is drunk: what was missing when the drink began, no more than the drink
holds. That turns the sign over — a salve drunk four hundred down pays four hundred
against what it wipes, and one drunk at full health pays nothing and wipes the same. A
mend broken by a blow has still been paid in full: the choice was right when it was
made, and what the opponent broke should not unmake the mark that chose it. Mana at a
half because it is bought at three a gold, and what the spells it feeds do is paid for
by the margins already.

**And it is worth that wherever it sits.** The first cut still counted a consumable as
gear — twice its price worn, half over riding — and the crowds obliged: they wore
their salves, hoarded them unspent, and filled all nine slots of the bag with prepaid
drinks until the courier had nowhere to set an upgrade down and carried it back to the
stash for the rest of the match. A consumable now counts at its face value in any
slot: buying one moves nothing, wearing one grows nothing, and the only mark it will
ever pay is the drinking. The working slots stay for gear, the bag drains itself, and
the deliveries land.

**It is the longest rung, not `grow rich`'s equal.** Two rungs of the same clock break
three things the ladder promises at once: that each runs longer than the last, that exactly
one lesson is still counting when a match ends, and that `Lesson::longest()` names one
lesson rather than whichever of two ties `max_by_key` happens to return. Five minutes more
is what it costs to avoid weakening all three, and in release that is about six minutes
across a whole ladder.

**`grow rich` stays.** A card scores every lesson off one match, so keeping both means every
report says what the same game was worth on each counting, and the gap between the two
numbers is what the bot has worn plus half of what it bought and left riding.

### Breeding

Lessons are taught by breeding rather than by gradient. A crowd of models plays the
lesson, the best are kept, and the crowd is refilled by copying them with noise added.
The crowd carries over from one lesson to the next.

What decided it was not determinism but this: **what is improved and what is reported
become the same number.** Under gradient they were two things and they came apart twice
in measurement — a run whose loose play climbed from 49 to 88 while its greedy play fell
from 63 to 21, and a lesson that sat at its starting mark for sixty rounds. Breeding
scores the match, and the match is also the report.

It also deletes seven numbers nobody could check: the discount, the window a decision is
credited over, the value head's share of the loss, the entropy bonus, the heat, the step
size and the batch. One of them was already known to be wrong — at the wave lesson the
loss ran to 2.6 because a creep pays ten and the value head's error swamped the policy's.
What replaces them is four with plain meanings: how many models, how many matches each,
how many survive, how far a child moves. The gradient trainer stayed under `descend`
while the two were compared, and went once breeding had held: `school.rs`, `step.rs`,
`roll.rs`, `adam.rs`, the value head, and the per-tick payment channel from the seat to
the mind, which only the trainer ever listened to.

Five decisions inside it.

**The trial seeds move with the generation.** A crowd judged on the same matches every
generation is a crowd selected for those matches, and with two hundred thousand numbers to
play with it will learn them rather than the game. Seeds are a function of which
generation it is, so a run still repeats to the byte — two runs of one seed were checked
to produce identical logs and identical weights — while no model is asked twice to do well
at the same match. A separate set that never moves is used to report and never to choose,
and a test asserts the two sets never meet.

**Children are handed round the survivors in turn** rather than heaped on the winner,
or a crowd becomes one model and its copies before a lesson has finished asking anything
of it.

**Ties never swap.** Two models worth the same keep the order they had, and a match that
came to nothing does not shuffle the crowd. Without that a run is not repeatable.

**The spread adapts by the fifth rule.** The (1+λ) search over the first bot's numbers
already learned this — it widened its nudge while more than a fifth of challengers won
and narrowed it while fewer did — and the crowd dropped it for a fixed `mutation` per
stage, which was a knob guessed per rung. It is back: a generation whose children beat
their parents more than a fifth of the time widens the spread by a fifth of itself, one
whose children lose narrows it by the same, and what the plan writes is only where it
starts. Parentage is read straight off the crowd's layout — child `at` was bred off
survivor `(at − keep) % keep` — so the first generation of a stage, whose crowd arrived
already reordered, is the one generation the rule sits out.

**And it is kept on a leash, eightfold either way of the plan's number.** Unleashed, a
five-hundred-generation stage walked the spread from a hundredth to twenty-six
thousand. The rule the (1+λ) search ran measured success against a frozen champion, so
success genuinely fell as the nudge grew; the crowd's verdict — children against
parents on the generation's own matches — is a coin flip whenever the two are worth
about the same, which is true at a tiny spread and at a huge one alike. A coin-flipped
multiplicative step is a driftless walk in the logarithm, and over enough generations
a driftless walk leaves any range: the spread wandered up, the children turned to
noise, the noise washed the elites out of the top eight two matches at a time, and the
crowd's middling fell by half while the printed best held — the best of thirty-two
noisy readings is a statement about tails, not about learning. The band cannot fix the
coin, but it fixes what the coin can cost.

**A stage draws apart from every other.** The trial seeds and the children's noise are
functions of the tribe's seed and the generation number alone — and every stage of
`train.yaml` fell back to the same default seed, so stage after stage retried the very
same few hundred mutation directions out of a 360-thousand-dimensional space, and was
judged on the very matches the stage before it had been selected for, which is the
overfit the moving trials exist to prevent. The stage's place in the sequence is now
folded into the seed in `plan.rs`, so a plan still repeats to the number while no stage
repeats another's draws.

The cost is known and was measured before building: breeding gets one number per match
where gradient gets one per decision, so it needs roughly a hundred times the matches. At
thirteen matches a second that is fine for the short rungs and marginal for the last,
where a match is twelve thousand ticks.

### The tournament

`selection: swiss` judges a generation by tournament instead of by mirror play. The
mirror stays, and stays the default: the early rungs are solo skills where the opponent
hardly matters, and one mirror match is the cheapest reading there is.

What pushed the tournament into existence is an arithmetic fact about the mirror score.
`worth_of` averages the two seats of one model, and a fight inside that average is a
wash: the gold a kill takes is gold the other seat lost, a deny is a last hit the other
seat never got, so the average moves only by the costs — consumables, time spent dead,
waves missed. The number being bred for was the pair's joint welfare, whose optimum is
two seats that stay out of each other's way. A crowd taught by mirror was selected for
pacifism, and any progress in aggression was invisible by construction.

The tournament scores margins instead: a model's card less its opponent's, summed over
its matches. A margin pays for farming and for suppression alike. It is also exact —
the simulation and greedy play are both deterministic, so a pairing's two matches, one
from either side to cancel the map's asymmetry, are a measurement rather than a sample.
What stays sampled is everything a single seed cannot show, which is why every round is
a fresh seed, common to all pairs of the round so that the comparison stays paired.

Three swiss rounds pair neighbours in the standing — first against second and so on —
which spends the matches where the order is still undecided. The first two run on a
quarter of the stage's clock: a coarse split is cheap, and the full clock is kept for
the round that settles the top. Rematches are allowed; a rematch lands on a new round's
new seed, so it is new evidence rather than a repeat. Then one anchor match, everybody
against the crowd's incoming best, from the same side on the same seed: it ties the
standings to something outside the round-robin of siblings, and the shared side and
seed make whatever bias they carry common to all. Only the challenger's margin moves on
it — the anchor stood its own rounds, and absorbing the whole crowd's challenges would
score it twice.

The bill, counted in full matches: two quarter rounds, one full round and the anchor
come to about two and a half times what the mirror pays for the same crowd. The number
printed each generation changes meaning too — a margin, not a mark, and margins do not
climb as the crowd does, because the opposition climbs with it. Progress under swiss is
read from `judge`, whose mirror card never moves with the crowd.

A full pairwise sort and a quickselect over head-to-head matches were considered and
dropped. Choosing needs a top-k, not an order; comparisons between two mutants of the
same elite are noisy and not transitive, and a recursive pivot compounds its early
mistakes where the swiss keeps adding evidence. A round-robin buys quadratic matches of
rank information the standings never use.

### The plan

`bota-bot train <FILE>` follows a plan: a YAML file naming a sequence of stages, each a
lesson and the crowd bred at it. `train.yaml` beside the crates is the ladder as it
stands, so the built-in run is a file rather than a branch.

It replaces a subcommand that took nine flags and applied all nine to all seven rungs.
Every real run wanted otherwise — a bigger crowd on the late rungs, more matches where
the variance is worst, a short clock while a lesson's marks are being read — and getting
it meant seven invocations chained by a shell loop, which is a ladder nobody else can
walk and one nothing records. A plan is the run, and it is a file that can be committed
beside the weights it produced.

**Field names are the ordinary ones**, not the crate's: `population`, `generations`,
`survivors`, `mutation`, `matches`. Inside, those are `folk`, `lives`, `keep`, `spread`,
`trials`, and the translation lives in `plan.rs` alone. The crate's vocabulary is worth
having where the code reasons about a crowd; a file somebody writes by hand at two in the
morning is not that place.

**A stage may say nothing but `score`.** What it leaves out comes from the plan's
`defaults`, and what those leave out comes from the lesson's own rung and a plain crowd.
Seven stages differing in one number each is the common case, and repeating nine fields
seven times is how a plan comes to disagree with itself.

**A stage's `ticks` moves the scoring window, not only the match limit.** A lesson used to
stop paying at its rung's tick count wherever the match ended, so a stage asking for a
longer clock than its rung would have run the extra ticks for nothing and reported the
same mark — a knob that silently does half of what it says. `Marker` now carries a window
per lesson instead of reading `LADDER`, and the taught lesson's is the stage's.

**The whole plan is checked before the first match.** Every stage is settled up front and
anything nonsense — a population of one, no survivors, a lesson nobody has heard of, a
field spelled wrong — is an error naming the stage. A run of several hours that stops on
its sixth stage over a typo has thrown away the five before it.

**Unknown fields are refused.** `serde(deny_unknown_fields)` on both, so `populaton: 40`
is an error rather than a setting silently ignored and a run that reads as though it did
what was asked.

**Where the weights live is the command's business, not the plan's.** A plan says what to
teach; `--weights` says which model is being taught, defaulting to the standing file. Kept
in the file, the same teaching run against a fresh model and against last week's would be
two plans differing in one line that has nothing to do with teaching.

**A run continues.** When the weights file already exists the crowd starts from it — the
kept body itself and children moved off it, exactly as a generation refills — rather than
from noise. Before this `train` always drew a fresh crowd and the file was only ever
written, so a ladder taught in the morning could not be taught further in the evening; the
gradient trainer already continued from what was there, and the two now agree.

`serde_yaml` is the eighth dependency. It is deprecated upstream and pinned at 0.9.34
knowing that: YAML here is a shallow map of scalars read once at startup, the crate is
frozen rather than abandoned, and nothing in the simulation touches it. Replacing it is
`plan.rs` and nothing else.

### What is not built yet

The other half of training. The design constraint that decides whether it is worth building at all: **every
deed the rule-driven bot can take must be one number in this list**, so that the first half
of training is copying a bot that already plays a respectable lane rather than a search
from nothing. That was measured on the first bot — a clone at 87% agreement played worse
than what it copied, at 92.6% it played better, and widening the choice beyond what the
teacher demonstrates cost twenty points. A second bot that threw the teacher away would be
starting a search at our budget of one match a second, which is where months go.

## Map2: mid-only play on the full Dota map

`MapId(2)` copies the single `DOTA` definition in `game/config/map.rs`, overriding
the wire id, creep-wave lane selection and upstream completion fields. No landmark, tree,
camp, terrain, or blocker tables are duplicated. `MapDef.lanes` and `lanes()`
remain geometric: Map0 and Map2 both have three lane centerlines, and tree
clearance and route construction still see all three. The separate
`wave_lanes` slice selects mid alone on Map2. Setting `lanes` to one instead
would leave extra trees on the side roads and change passability and vision,
so it would not preserve the full map. Static side-lane structures and the
jungle remain active. Map0 and the hero demo Map1 keep the upstream data, wave
order and completion rules: neither loses on a tower or hero death. The prior
local Map1 short-ending rules are not restored during the upstream merge.

Map2 ends when a side loses its second hero life, counted across that side's
seats, or its first tower on any lane. All deaths of a tick are processed
before adjudication; if both sides lose on that tick, the result is a draw.
This includes a tower lost on one side and a second hero death on the other.
Choosing a winner inside the burial loop would make that draw depend on hit
iteration order. Couriers do not consume hero lives. An Ancient is not a
separate Map2 win condition: its normal protection cannot open before a tower
has already ended the match.

The limit is fifteen gameplay minutes at the fixed simulation rate, 27,000 ticks,
plus the unchanged 900 pregame ticks. Tick 27,900 runs completely, including
orders, scheduled waves, economy, combat, and death accounting, then draws
even if one side loses on that tick. A loss at 27,899 still wins immediately.
Wall-clock `tick_rate` and realtime/lockstep mode do not alter this limit.
`World::advance` and `World::step` stop mutating a completed Map2, including
orders with immediate shop side effects. A world already at the cap seals
the draw without running a late tick. Map0/Map1 do not gain either this cap
or this post-completion freeze.

`World::victor()` and the existing native `ServerMsg::MatchOver.winner` use
`Team::Neutral` to mean a Map2 draw, not a jungle victory. This avoids a new
wire outcome schema: TCP and in-process runners read the same World result
and `match_stats().duration` after the final tick. The existing globally
visible `StructureDestroyed` event identifies the fallen tower and side;
final seat death counts and duration identify life-limit and cap endings.
There is no new reason field in MatchOver. Consumers must classify Neutral
as Draw rather than as a loss for both seats. The existing bota client banner
for this value reads `NOBODY WINS`; this change does not modify the viewer.

## Mango and stacking Shadowraze: the 2026-09-10 balance choice

These are authorized bota mechanics, not a claim of parity with the latest Dota
patch. The conventional Mango price and restoration and raze stack bonuses were
chosen explicitly; the existing bota raze base damage and cast rules are retained.
No Teacher strategy, neural tensor schema, training data, or saved model is changed
here. Action candidates and feature migrations remain the consumer's work.

### Exact Mango rules

`game::ITEM_MANGO` is appended as `42`; `game::ITEMS` and the client item catalog
now contain 43 entries. Ids 0 through 41 keep their meanings. The shop still sends
an ordinary `ShopEntry`, and carried Mangoes use existing `ItemView.charges`.
Public constants in `game/config/item.rs`, re-exported through `game`, are:

| Constant | Exact value |
|---|---|
| `MANGO_COST` | 65 gold for one charge |
| `MANGO_STACK_MAX` | 3 charges per slot |
| `MANGO_MANA` | 100 mana per use |
| `MANGO_HP_REGEN` | `Fixed::from_ratio(2, 5 * TICKS_PER_SECOND)` per charge per tick |

At 30 ticks/s the passive is 873 raw Q16.16 HP per tick per charge, or exactly
0.399627685546875 HP/s. Each charge is quantized before multiplication: stacks
of one, two and three add 873, 1746 and 2619 raw HP/tick. Splitting or merging
stacks cannot change their combined regeneration. A float, a coarse hundredth-HP
timed effect and an extra fractional accumulator were rejected: the existing
fixed-point regeneration path supplies a deterministic, sufficiently close
representation of the nominal 0.4 HP/s without more state.

Mango has zero mana cost, zero cooldown, zero range and `Aim::Own`. Both
`Target::None` and an explicit self handle are legal. One successful use consumes
exactly one charge and restores `min(100, max_mana - mana)` immediately. Any
strictly positive deficit, including one raw Q16.16 unit, qualifies. Full or
overfull mana, a missing pool or nonpositive capacity cannot consume a charge.
The order validator reports `NotReady` for an ineffective restoration and
`WrongTargetKind` for any non-self target. This is a legal-action rule, not a
strategy requiring a 100-mana deficit. Wasting a charge at full mana and reusing
Stick/Wand's all-charges restoration were rejected. `ItemUse::ReplenishMana` is a
server-only appended variant; no order or wire field is added.

The merged upstream protocol already carries `Healed.mana`. Mango uses that
contract: one consumption emits a mana-only `Healed` event with the actual
clamped restoration in whole points and the usual healing visibility. Restoring
less than one whole point consumes the charge but emits no zero-valued event,
matching upstream's positive whole-point reporting. Rejected use and subsequent
passive regeneration emit no consumption event. Mango adds no further wire fields.

Only unmuted inventory slots 0 through 5 grant the per-charge passive or permit
use. Backpack slots 6 through 8 and stash slots 9 through 14 remain inert. Moving
out of the backpack into inventory imposes the existing 180-tick mute. Consumption
reduces the passive at the next normal stats derivation; the last charge removes
the slot. Couriers transport charges intact and receive no item stat bonuses.
The hero's bag and a dead courier's load keep their charges through the existing
seat-owned death/respawn path.

`ItemDef::stack_limit` opts into merging; zero preserves every older item's bundled
charge behavior. A purchase fills a compatible Mango stack before taking an empty
slot in its destination. At the home shop (the existing 1000-unit fountain circle)
the bag is preferred to the stash; elsewhere only the stash receives purchases.
Affordability and capacity are checked before mutation, including stack space when
no slot is empty. Explicit slot moves merge up to three, leaving excess charges in
the source; a full or incompatible destination uses the existing swap behavior.
Courier and ground-item transfers keep whole stacks rather than adding a global
automatic merge pass. This preserves their existing slot-capacity behavior and
avoids another per-tick scan. Invalid courier backpack destinations are checked
before taking the source, closing the charge-loss case reproduced by the tests.

Merge compatibility requires the same id, owner, attribute mode and sale mark.
The resulting stack takes the oldest purchase tick, the OR of touched flags and
the maximum cooldown and mute. An explicit move touches both remaining stacks.
Per-charge purchase histories were rejected: conservative stack metadata can
reduce a fresh charge's refund eligibility, but cannot renew an old charge's
refund window, remove its mute, or launder ownership. Only the purchaser may sell.
Sale returns 65 times the remaining charges for an untouched stack aged at most
300 ticks. Otherwise the entire remaining value is halved with integer floor:
one, two and three charges return 32, 65 and 97 gold. Consumed charges are never
refunded. Remote sale marks and courier return sales retain the existing paths.

`World::purchase_fits` exposes the capacity check independently of gold;
`World::can_replenish_mana` exposes the self-target, live-user and positive-deficit
check. Slot, charge, cooldown, mute and disable validation remain separate.

### Exact Shadowraze rules

| Constant in `game::rules` | Exact value |
|---|---|
| `RAZE_DAMAGE` | 90, 160, 230, 300 magical damage at levels 1 through 4, unchanged |
| `RAZE_STACK_DAMAGE` | 50, 60, 70, 80 per prior valid same-caster stack |
| `RAZE_DEBUFF_TICKS` | 240 ticks, exactly 8 seconds at 30 ticks/s |
| `RAZE_MAX_STACKS` | 255 per victim and full caster generation |
| `RAZE_MAX_SOURCES` | 16 independent caster records per victim |
| `RAZE_DISTANCE` | 200, 450, 700 world units, unchanged |
| `RAZE_RADIUS` | 250 world units, unchanged |
| `RAZE_MANA` | 75, 80, 85, 90 mana by level, unchanged |
| `RAZE_COOLDOWN` | 300 ticks independently for each reach, unchanged |

A hit first reads the current valid count for its exact caster and adds that count
times the bonus at the current cast level to the base damage. The total then passes
through the existing magical resistance and integer truncation. For example,
level-one hits at zero resistance deal 90, 140, 190, 240; at 25% resistance they
deal 67, 105, 142, 180. At level four and the maximum count, raw damage is 20,700,
inside the fixed-point pool range. The count is a saturating `u8`; a compile-time
assertion ties its maximum to the declared cap. A hard cap of three was rejected:
the three reach slots are casts, not the lifetime limit of a debuff.

Every positive-damage hit on a surviving victim adds one stack and refreshes that
caster's entire count to 240 ticks, including hits at the count cap. No separate
timer is stored per hit. A hit applied in tick H is valid through H+239; gear
ticking removes it before casts resolve at H+240. A refreshing hit at H+239 gets
the bonus and starts a new 240-tick interval. A hit at H+240 gets base damage and
starts at one. Different casters, including allied casters hitting the same enemy
or opposing casters hitting a neutral, neither borrow nor refresh each other's
counts. At the 16-source storage limit, a new source evicts the record with the
least time left, with current record order breaking ties. Refreshing an existing
source evicts nothing. Expired records are discarded before capacity selection.

The source key and count are an appended `StatusKind::Shadowraze` on the victim's
existing timed `Statuses`, not a permanent `Stacks` entry kept on its seat. Target
death and respawn therefore cannot carry the debuff into a new body. A source's
record can finish its timer after that source dies, but its respawned or reused
arena index has a different generation and cannot use the old bonus. This avoids
a lifecycle hook in `fight.rs`, another world table, and a cleanup pass scanning
all victims on every death.

An appended server-only `HitEffect::Shadowraze` tags the queued damage with the
zero-based cast level. Stack lookup and application happen in the existing hit
resolution phase, in damage queue order. Two queued razes from one caster thus
observe each other's successful hits. Applying a status when merely queuing a
cast was rejected: an earlier queued lethal hit or invulnerability at resolution
could leave a debuff for damage that never happened. Misses, allies, failed casts
(including casts initiated by an already-dead caster), invulnerability, and damage
reduced or rounded to zero add no stack
and do not refresh one. Resolution also reads an active Shielded status directly:
a shield cast in that phase must protect before the next stats derivation. The
old stat-only check failed a regression test of this boundary. Fatal hits need
no new status on the dying body. Ordinary
magical hits are not razes and cannot receive or build this bonus. Existing
facing, no-target casting, shared learning, and hostile/visible target selection
are unchanged; no movement slow or additional disable is introduced.

A valid cast already queued while its source was alive keeps its damage and
stacking behavior if an earlier blow in the same resolution batch kills that
source. Cancelling it or suppressing only its effect would make the accepted
cast depend on unrelated queue position; it follows the existing queued-damage
model instead. The resulting record still belongs to the dead generation, never
to its respawn. A separate regression test pins this posthumous-hit boundary.

### Public effects, hashes and integration

`game::EFFECT_SHADOWRAZE` is `15`. Upstream's Guarded tower aura keeps id 13 and
Inspired flagbearer aura keeps id 14; the pre-rebase Shadowraze id 13 is retired
to avoid aliasing unrelated effects. Each active
source appears on a visible victim as the existing three-field `EffectView`:
`id = EffectId(15)`, `ticks_left = Some(1..=240)`, `stacks = Some(1..=255)`.
Multiple sources yield multiple anonymous rows, each preserving its own count
and timer pair. No source field or new status bit is added to the protocol. The
caster's internal handle is never projected in these rows, including when the
caster is fogged. Consumers can use public counts/timers without raw hidden
caster ids in tensors; identifying an anonymous row's caster is not promised.
Hidden victims remain absent under ordinary fog rules. The client shows `Razed`
and Mango text without a new icon dependency.

The world hash includes raze source index and generation, count and timer, and
queued hit effect/level before resolution. The item hash now also covers merge
ownership, mode, sale marks, the dead courier's kept bag and complete ground item
stacks; carried charges and other stack timers were already hashed. Tests reproduced the missing hash distinctions
before the additions. No hash baseline or older snapshot artifact is rewritten.

Tests were written against numeric ids and the old behavior first. Original
pre-rebase release red/green evidence and the integration report live under
`drysua/artifacts/temp/map2-mid-20260910/mechanics/` in the containing workspace.
Verification covers exact damage, queue order, all four levels, tick boundaries,
source separation, source bounds, generations, death/respawn, fog and codec
projection, plus Mango purchase, legal use, passive, storage, transfer, sale and
metadata conservation. It does not claim neural learning or latest-patch parity.
Rebase integration tests additionally pin simultaneous aura/raze projection and
stat bonuses, the mana-healing wire event, Mango's embedded drawing, and the
fifteen-minute cap including continuation through the old ten-minute boundary.

## Cheat-granted unit modifiers, and the general stats behind them

A modifier is a bounded stat change that only a cheat can put on and only its
countdown or the fall of the body can take away. Every modifier has unit
scope: it is carried in `World::applied`, a table of `AppliedModifier` values
apart from `Modifiers`, so no ability, item, dispel or ordinary expiry reaches
it. It does not show in `MatchInfo` or `UnitView.effects`, and the hash
includes one only when it is present, so an unmodified world hashes as it
always did. A unit's copy is removed on `despawn`, so a respawned body starts
clean and re-application is the cheat caller's business. The countdown runs at
the end of the tick that applies it, so `ticks` counts the applying tick as
the first.

**The payload is a bounded spec, not one cheat per stat.** `Cheat::ApplyModifier`
carries a `ModifierSpec` of signed basis-point fields (10,000 nominal for
scales, hundredths of a percentage point for resistances) plus a tick count
bounded by `MAX_MODIFIER_TICKS`; `Cheat::ClearModifiers` takes the change away.
The server gate rejects out-of-bounds specs and tick counts with
`RejectReason::BadCheat` before the world ever sees them, and `World::cheat`
turns away anything unbounded that arrived another way. The variants are
appended, so existing cheat tags keep their numbers; the order budget test now
allows 80 bytes for cheat orders and keeps 32 for everything else, because a
whole spec no longer fits the old room; the widest possible order (every
number at its wire maximum) measures 70 bytes and is pinned, and the canonical
bytes of one spec order are pinned in `bota-proto`.

**Modifiers are folded first and additively.** `derive_stats` applies a unit's
spec immediately after the raised base block and before carried items,
attributes, auras, slows and every other stage, so the modifier is part of the
base the rest of the pipeline works on. Every family is summed as a delta:
resistances add in their own units, scales add as deltas of the nominal 10,000
so that sources never compound, and the fold happens once. The magnitudes
(`move_speed`, `max_hp`, `max_mana`) are scaled from the raised base at that
point; flat item bonuses, strength and intelligence, and the `Slowed` or
`Hastened` multipliers all land on top and are not scaled again. An applied maximum
is just another source of the maximum: when it moves for a living body, the
pool keeps its filled fraction (`hp' = hp * new / old`, clamped to the new
maximum), so a full pool stays full, a body at three fifths stays at three
fifths, and a pool that held anything stays non-empty. A respawned body has
no earlier pool to scale and stands at its full effective maximum, and a unit
seeded at match start is settled once its rules have landed, so a standing
tower or hero is full at the scaled maximum immediately. The mechanics are real
derived stats, neutral by default: `Stats` gains `status_resist_bp`,
`physical_amp_bp`, `magic_amp_bp`, `pure_amp_bp`, `cooldown_rate_bp` and
`mana_cost_rate_bp`, while magic resistance was already a stat and the spec
adds to it. The fold compiles out when the whole table is empty, so the default
game pays nothing; hitting compiles its share out the same way, because the
amplification multiply runs only in a world where some applied change exists.
Future items, auras or abilities can add to the same fields without touching
any consumer. Every unit kind walks the same derive, so one `max_hp` scale
covers heroes, lane and neutral creeps, and buildings alike.

**Each stat has one reading.** Magic resistance is added as a delta and clamped
to `0..=100` percent before Flesh Heap multiplies it, so mitigation, projection
and the bots agree. Damage amplification scales a blow before armor and
resistance, after Shadowraze stack composition, per the dealing unit's kind
field; a blow with no source is left alone, and pure damage stays unmitigated
but still scales. Status resistance scales the ticks of `Stunned`, `Feared` and
`Slowed` wherever they are put on — an ability, an item and an aura all pass
through the same point — down to one tick, and never touches buffs; the time
already held is not shortened a second time when a disable is extended. A hold
that is put on afresh every tick for as long as its channel runs (Dismember,
the hook's drag) has its recorded ticks shortened like any other, but its
length is governed by the channel and not by the countdown.
Cooldown rate scales every cooldown at the moment it is set: a cast, an item
use, a shared item wait and the break-on-damage mute, with a floor of one tick
for a cooldown that was set at all. It never scales the decrement, so a cooldown
keeps its stored value and every view of it stays exact. Mana cost rate scales
every read of a cost: the order gate, the cast and use that charge it,
`AbilityView.mana_cost` and `ItemView.mana_cost`, so an action the view calls
affordable is accepted and charged the same amount. Gold income scales the
bounty a killing unit is paid: `pay_for` scales the composed bounty once as it
is credited to the killer, so bringing down a creep, hero or building earns
more. Passive gold, starting gold, sale refunds and death losses are not
bounties and are left alone. A stat change applied mid-tick is seen by
everything derived or read after it; a disable put on before the first derive
in that tick (a hook stun beside the application) is the one boundary that
still reads the previous tick's resistance.

**Trusted setup can put modifiers on spawns.** A match description carries a
bounded list of spawn modifiers (`SpawnModifier`), each a selector (a side, an
exact kind or category), an existing `ModifierSpec` and a duration:
`MatchLong` until the body falls, or a tick count. `World::for_match`
copies the list into the world, puts it on every unit already standing
(buildings included) and, through `spawn_body`, on every unit stood up later;
each wave, each camp, each building and each respawned body gets the rules
afresh, with the tick count of a `Ticks` rule restarting on the new body. The
cheat order path is untouched and independent: a unit may carry both, and
clearing a cheat leaves what trusted setup put there alone.
`MatchConfig::validate` refuses a spec outside the bounds the cheat gate uses,
a duration outside `1..=MAX_MODIFIER_TICKS`, and a list past
`MAX_SPAWN_MODIFIERS`, naming the rule that failed; `World::for_match` calls
it and stops loudly rather than dropping a rule, and a rule that somehow
reaches a spawn unchecked does the same. The hash covers every spec field and
the rule list itself while any of it is present, so an unmodified world hashes
as it always did; a setup that does not carry the list at all behaves exactly
as before, and the empty-list guards keep the default game paying nothing.
The server binary does not expose the list: the TCP lobby always starts with
an empty one, and the entry point is the library value a setup builds in
process.
