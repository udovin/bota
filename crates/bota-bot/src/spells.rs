//! What an ability is, beyond what the wire says about it.
//!
//! A snapshot carries an ability's level, its wait and what a cast would cost,
//! but not whether it can be cast at all or what it must be aimed at. Those
//! are the server's rules, and a bot that guesses at them spends its ticks on
//! orders that come back refused — a thousand of them in the first match this
//! was left out of, which is a thousand creeps not swung at.
//!
//! So the bot keeps its own list, by the number the wire names an ability
//! with. An ability that is not on it is treated as one that cannot be cast:
//! saying nothing is better than being wrong about it.
