//! What the model may choose, and what a choice means.
//!
//! A flat, numbered list. Every number means one thing and means it on every
//! tick: number nineteen is always "step forward and left", never "swing at
//! whatever happens to be nearest". Where a deed names a body it names it by
//! its place in [`Field`], which is settled in one place for exactly this
//! reason.
//!
//! The list is laid out as blocks, and a block is added by putting it in
//! [`BLOCKS`] and giving it an arm. Nothing counts indices by hand: the
//! offsets are worked out from the table, and a test walks every index there
//! and back again.
//!
//! **Legality is decided here, not by the model.** Every tick comes with a
//! flag per deed saying whether it could be carried out, and the model is
//! never allowed to pick one that could not. Letting it choose a deed that
//! cannot happen and taking the points off afterwards was considered and
//! dropped: an order is one a tick, so a wasted pick is a lost creep, and the
//! rules of what is legal are known to us for nothing. What the flags do earn
//! is a model that never has to spend its capacity learning them.
