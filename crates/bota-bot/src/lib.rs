//! A bot that decides by naming one of a fixed list of deeds.
//!
//! The contract is three pieces and nothing else. [`Field`] reads a tick into
//! a settled shape; [`sight`] turns that into the numbers a model is shown;
//! [`Deed`] is the numbered list of what may be chosen, with a flag per deed
//! saying whether it could be done and one way of turning a choice into an
//! order.
//!
//! Between them sits a [`Mind`], which is handed numbers and flags and answers
//! with one number. That is the whole of the seam: a mind that knows what a
//! creep is has reached across it, and a game that knows what a weight is has
//! reached back. [`Learned`] is the mind that is a network; the rest of the
//! crate would not notice another.
