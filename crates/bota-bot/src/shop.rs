//! What the bot buys, and the little it needs to know about items.
//!
//! Kept apart from the deeds because it is the one piece of taste in the list:
//! "buy" is a single deed, and what that buys is a shopping list rather than a
//! decision the model makes. When the model should be choosing the item too,
//! this becomes a block of deeds and nothing else moves.
//!
//! Prices and parts are written out here rather than read off the wire, because
//! neither crosses it: a snapshot carries which item sits in a slot and nothing
//! about what it cost. So this table mirrors the server's by hand, and nothing
//! checks that it still does. A price that drifts is not an error anywhere — it
//! is a net worth quietly counted wrong.
