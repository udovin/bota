//! Teaching by breeding rather than by gradient.
//!
//! A crowd of models plays the lesson, the best of them are kept, and the rest
//! of the crowd is refilled by copying those with noise added. No credit is
//! worked out for any single decision: what is scored is the match, which is
//! also what is reported, so the thing being improved and the thing being
//! measured cannot come apart.
//!
//! Three things about the shape of it.
//!
//! **The trial seeds move.** A crowd judged on the same handful of matches
//! every generation is a crowd being selected for those matches, and with two
//! hundred thousand numbers to play with it will learn them. The seeds are a
//! function of which generation it is, so a run is still repeatable to the
//! number while no model is ever asked twice to do well at the same match. A
//! separate set that never moves is used to report, and never to choose.
//!
//! **Ranks, not marks.** A lesson pays five for shopping and forty-five for a
//! wave, so choosing by the marks themselves would mean a different pressure
//! on every rung. Rank has no units.
//!
//! **The crowd carries over.** A lesson ends with the same number of models it
//! started with, and the next lesson starts from those. What is inherited is a
//! crowd rather than a champion: a lesson's best is often narrow, and the one
//! behind it is what the next lesson turns out to want.
