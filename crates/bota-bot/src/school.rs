//! Teaching the model a lesson.
//!
//! A round is: play some matches with the model choosing loosely, credit every
//! decision with what followed it, and move the weights towards the choices
//! that were followed by more than the model expected. Then measure what it
//! has become, on the same matches every time, and keep it only if it is
//! better than the best so far.
//!
//! Three things here are answers to what the first bot got wrong.
//!
//! **The baseline is learned.** How good a decision was is what followed it
//! less what was expected of that position, and expecting is the value head's
//! job. The first bot had no value head and had to invent baselines — the
//! match's own score, then the average over decisions at the same point on the
//! clock — and they were measured against each other and came out a tie. What
//! a tie was pointing at is that neither was a baseline.
//!
//! **What is measured does not move.** The same seeds every round, the model
//! choosing greedily, and the number reported is what the lesson paid. A
//! round's own matches are worth whatever their seeds were worth, so reading
//! that as progress is reading the luck of the draw.
//!
//! **Only what measures better is kept.** Practising wanders as much as it
//! climbs, and a run that writes out its last weights rather than its best
//! throws away the good ones on the way past.
