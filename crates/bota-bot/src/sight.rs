//! The numbers a model is shown.
//!
//! One place, one layout, and a table that says what is in it. A block is
//! added by putting it in [`LAYOUT`] and writing the piece that fills it;
//! nothing counts offsets by hand, and a test holds the table to the length it
//! claims. The names are there so that a weight can be traced back to a thing
//! in the game when a trained model does something strange.
//!
//! Everything is brought to about the same size before it goes in. A model fed
//! gold in thousands and health in fractions spends its first thousand steps
//! learning the scale rather than the game. Distances are in thousands of
//! world units, because a lane is fifteen of those and a swing reaches half of
//! one.
//!
//! Nothing here is absolute. Where a body is, is where it is from the bot and
//! which way the bot is facing up the map, so one set of weights serves both
//! ends of it. What is missing — a creep that is not there, a hero out of
//! sight — is a nought in its place and a nought in the flag that says it is
//! there, never a made-up number.
