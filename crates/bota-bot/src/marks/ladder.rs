//! The lessons, and everything settled about each of them.
//!
//! A match pays almost nothing almost all of the time, and a policy started
//! from nothing has to stumble into a creep kill by accident before it learns
//! anything at all. So it is not asked to learn the game at once. Seven
//! lessons, each a longer match than the last, each paid for something
//! narrower than winning.
//!
//! How long a lesson runs and what it is called are here. What it pays for is
//! one file, named after it. Nothing else in the crate branches on which lesson
//! is being taught except [`score`](crate::score), which is the one place that
//! turns a lesson into its own function.
