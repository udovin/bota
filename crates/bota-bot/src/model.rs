//! The model, and the only place that knows what it is built with.
//!
//! Two heads over one trunk. The policy head gives a number per deed and the
//! value head gives one number for the tick — what this position is worth,
//! whatever is chosen. The value head is not decoration: without it every
//! decision has to be judged against a made-up baseline, which was tried in
//! the first bot and came out a tie.
//!
//! The trunk is fed the last few ticks rather than only the newest, because a
//! swing that has begun, a creep that is about to die and a creep that has
//! just died look the same in one frame. Frames rather than a memory of its
//! own: what history is worth here is mostly the last second, and a memory
//! that has to be carried through twelve thousand ticks and reset on every
//! death costs more to train than that is worth.
//!
//! **The mask is applied to the numbers, not to the choice afterwards.** A
//! deed that cannot be done has its number sent to nothing before anything is
//! compared, so it can never come out on top and never has a gradient. Picking
//! freely and taking the points off later was considered and dropped: there is
//! one order a tick, so a wasted pick is a lost creep.
