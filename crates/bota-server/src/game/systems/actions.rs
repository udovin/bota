//! What a body does: the attack cycle, and the abilities and items it casts.
//!
//! A body does one thing at a time. Who to attack is put in [`Target`] by
//! acquisition, by a creep's own mind or by an order; what to cast is put in
//! `Orders.pending` by an order. Coming round to face either is movement's
//! business. A swing begins only once the target can be seen, is in reach,
//! and the attacker is looking near enough at it; a cast begins once what it
//! is aimed at is in reach.
