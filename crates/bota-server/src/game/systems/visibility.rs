/// A side always sees its own, and both sides always see a building. What
/// hides asks for two things at once from any other side: ordinary sight of
/// where it stands, and true sight reaching it. True sight takes nothing off
/// what hides in ground nobody is looking at. Beyond
/// that, everything that can see is walked
/// in turn against everything inside its sight radius, and the line is traced
/// only for what its side cannot already see: once one pair of eyes has an
/// entity, no other pair of the same side pays for it again.
/// What working out sight reads and writes.
///
/// The set runs past what is readable named one by one at a call site;
/// gathered here, the access a system takes is still declared, and still
/// checked when [`World::step`] hands the tables over.
