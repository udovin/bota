//! [`engine`] is how state is kept and walked and knows nothing of Dota;
//! [`game`] is the game itself and knows nothing about sockets. Everything a
//! participant is allowed to see leaves through `bota-proto`; everything else,
//! including the randomness, stays here.
//!
//! See `DESIGN.md` for the architecture this follows from.
